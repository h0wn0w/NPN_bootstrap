<ul>
<li><a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html">Twitter-Bootstrap</a> is the core framework of this site</li>
<li><a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/cms/">MultiMarkdown CMS</a> is the secondary site framework, and is used for management of articles and site search. A special thank you goes to <a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/">Fletcher Penney, MD</a>, author of MultiMarkdown CMS, who provided assistance in troubleshooting bugs during the development phase.</li>
<li>Select code from <a href="http://datatables.net/blog/Twitter_Bootstrap_2">DataTables</a> was used to create the interactive user interface for the "iOS Apps for Neuropsychologists" table.</li>
<li><a href="http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a> gave us great icons</li>

<h3 id="hosting">Hosting</h3>

<p><a href="http://neuropsychnow.com">NeuropsychNow.com</a> is hosted on <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/">NearlyFreeSpeech.Net</a>. The structure of NearlyFreeSpeech.Net affords us incredible flexibility with site build and maintenance. They also provide a pricing plan based on a &#8220;pay what you use&#8221; model. This allows us to host this site for literally pennies per day, which in turn lets us deliver our content, paid or free, at a lower cost to you than we would otherwise be able to. If you have, or are building, a web site, consider using NearlyFreeSpeech.Net as your hosting provider. </p>

<p>The source code for <a href="http://neuropsychnow.com">NeuropsychNow.com</a> is on <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>. GitHub allows Drs. Testa and Buddin to easily collaborate on all the things that comprise Neuropsych Now, and then quickly push them out to you. It&#8217;s really great. </p>

<p>Downloads are managed with <a href="https://droplr.com/hello">Droplr</a>. Using Droplr essentially shunts bandwidth from our host server to theirs, and also provides a very clean, simple download interface. It&#8217;s also free, so everybody wins. </p>

<h3 id="thanksandsupport">Thanks and Support</h3>

<p>Neuropsych Now thanks all of the developers of the aforementioned components for their hard work, without which this site would look and function very differently, and not in a good way. </p>

<p>One-hundred percent of the code used to construct this site is <a href="http://www.dict.org/bin/Dict?Form=Dict2&amp;Database=*&amp;Query=open+source">open source</a>, meaning that it is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and re-distribute. The impetus for the open source movement was the simple idea that things would move along much more quickly if an unrestricted number of individuals were allowed to contribute to original projects. This philosophy quickly spread and has led to an incredible advancement in software development as a result. The inception and ongoing mission of Neuropsych Now is, in part, an attempt to perpetuate and extend that philosophy to the field of neuropsychology by encouraging and allowing like-minded individuals to easily draw from, and contribute to, a collective knowledge source. </p>
