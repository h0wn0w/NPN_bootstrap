<p>April 22, 2014: Perhaps you slept a little late that morning, or didn&#8217;t check your email. Maybe you <em>just missed</em> the window of opportunity, and didn&#8217;t snag a copy of <em>An Examination of the Frequency of Invalid Forgetting on the Test of Memory Malingering</em> <a href="http://neuropsychnow.com/2014/04/theIFFI">when we linked to a limited number of free downloads</a>. </p>
