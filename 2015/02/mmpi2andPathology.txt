In their just–released article, *Reaffirming normal: The high risk of pathologizing healthy adults when interpreting the MMPI-2-RF*, Odland, Lammy, Perle, Martin, and Grote (2015) post up an insightful and thoughtful study of potential flaws and dangers inherent in a straightforward (read: failure to consider statistical precepts as well as contextual variables) interpretation of the MMPI–2–RF. My favorite line from this paper: 
>"Asserting that the MMPI is somehow immune from type I error is to eschew fundamental statistical probabilities."

Amen. 

Dr. Odland contacted us and extended his link to 50 free copies of their article, available [here](http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/EbmBcBfitMjNB5Mv8FWe/full#.VNJ5quz74LY.gmail) while they last. Neuropsych Now extends a massive Thank You to Odland, Lammy, Perle, Martin, and Grote for their hard work and for enabling free access to good science!
