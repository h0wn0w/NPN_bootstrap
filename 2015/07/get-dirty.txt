Are you in the market for a new set of research tools to help you with your next great study, article, project, paper…whatever? Have you finally had enough of old, unsupported, bloated software packages? If so, then [DiRT][dt] might just be the place to start. From the web site: 

>"The DiRT Directory is a registry of digital research tools for scholarly use."

That basically says it all. As a side note, one of the listings I came across – the [Open Science Framework][of] – is ridiculously cool.
