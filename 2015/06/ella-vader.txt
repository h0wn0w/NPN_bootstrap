We are launching an experimental sort of project for Neuropsych Now, and hope that you can help. The meta-goal is advocacy. The more focused goal is deriving better ways of telling people what it is, exactly, that we do. So, we devised a fiendishly brilliant plan that we believe might help. What we ask is that anyone and everyone interested send us your best "elevator speech" or "pitch" that you do/would use when describing to others what you/neuropsychologists do. For the uninitiated, we define "elevator speech/pitch" as: 

* A synopsis of your current or future plan(s)/employment/job title, etc. that takes no longer than 15 seconds to say. 
* It does not have to literally be stated in an elevator. The elevator part is just to convey that you have a captive audience for a *super brief* window of time. 

There you go. No other parameters. The underlying idea is that your pitch is clear, easily understood ("5 by 5," as they say), and could have a direct impact on your near future. Anyone interested can send us their pitch by clicking below:

We will post some (all?) of the submissions next week, so if you want your brilliant elevator speech to be available for everyone then send it soon! Last thing: unless you tell us otherwise, we will list entries without attribution, keeping you anonymous. If you want us to know who you are, just say so in your submission!
