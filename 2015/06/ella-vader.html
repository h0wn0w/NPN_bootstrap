<p>We are launching an experimental sort of project for Neuropsych Now, and hope that you can help. The meta-goal is advocacy. The more focused goal is deriving better ways of telling people what it is, exactly, that we do. So, we devised a fiendishly brilliant plan that we believe might help. What we ask is that anyone and everyone interested send us your best &#8220;elevator speech&#8221; or &#8220;pitch&#8221; that you do/would use when describing to others what you/neuropsychologists do. For the uninitiated, we define &#8220;elevator speech/pitch&#8221; as: </p>

<ul>
<li>A synopsis of your current or future plan(s)/employment/job title, etc. that takes no longer than 15 seconds to say.</li>
<li>It does not have to literally be stated in an elevator. The elevator part is just to convey that you have a captive audience for a <em>super brief</em> window of time.</li>
</ul>

<p>There you go. No other parameters. The underlying idea is that your pitch is clear, easily understood (&#8220;5 by 5,&#8221; as they say), and could have a direct impact on your near future. Anyone interested can send us their pitch by clicking below:</p>

<p><span><a class="btn btn-info" href="mailto:admin@neuropsychnow.com?subject=Neuropsych%20Elevator%20Pitch">Send my pitch</a></span></p>

<p>We will post some (all?) of the submissions next week, so if you want your brilliant elevator speech to be available for everyone then send it soon! Last thing: unless you tell us otherwise, we will list entries without attribution, keeping you anonymous. If you want us to know who you are, just say so in your submission!</p>
