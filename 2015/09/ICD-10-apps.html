<h1 id="icd-10apps">ICD&#8211;10 APPS</h1>

<p>As we scramble &#8211; now and for the forseeable future &#8211; towards/within the new ICD - 10 coding system, we could probably use a little help along the way. So, here is a list of a few iOS and Android applications to help ease the transition. Please note: by &#8220;ease the transition,&#8221; what we mean is &#8220;attempt to continue to get paid.&#8221;</p>

<p>The idea of listing these apps within the context of an article was to make them more immediately accessible; however, you can also find them on our <a href="http://neuropsychnow.com/neuroapps.html">mobile apps</a> page. Eventually.</p>

<p><em>P.S.</em> If at some point &#8211; today or at some other time &#8211; you have found something on our site that saved you time or money, then we can put a checkmark in the &#8220;W&#8221; column<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>, which is pretty great. If you feel like showing us some love, then please help us keep Neuropsych Now running <a href="http://neuropsychnow.com/contribute.html">with a super-small donation</a>. </p>

<h2 id="iosapps">iOS Apps</h2>

<p><a href="https://appsto.re/us/aL1U6.i">ICD&#8211;10 HCPCS ICD&#8211;9</a> by drchrono Inc. seems to have lots of features. I did not try this one out, but I do know you have to register an account with Dr. Chrono to get full use (account is free). </p>

<p>Honestly, I could not tell the difference between the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/icd-10-on-the-go-medical-codes/id377273816?mt=8">ICD 10 On the Go Medical Codes</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/icd-10-free/id878887635?mt=8">ICD 10 Free</a>. They&#8217;re by the same developer (VLR), have the same version number<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a>, and even use the same screenshots in their respective descriptions. I guess it comes down to which icon you like more. The former runs $6.99, whereas the latter has an in-app purchase of $6.99 to unlock the &#8220;premium&#8221; features. Also, there is the <a href="https://appsto.re/us/I39iR.i">ICD 10 Codes Free</a> app by SvmSoft, which looks exactly like the other two in all ways, screenshots included. It also will cost $6.99 to unlock the &#8220;premium&#8221; version. By the way, none of what I say should be considered indictments of this triumverate; these are merely observations that I make. </p>

<h2 id="androidapps">Android apps</h2>

<p><em>Note:</em> since there is no companion iOS app for the following few listings, and since I don&#8217;t own an Android device (or emulator, through, e.g., <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>), I couldn&#8217;t say anything meaningful about them. </p>

<h2 id="iosandandroid">iOS <em>and</em> Android</h2>

<p><em>ICD&#8211;10 Virtual Code Book</em> by Precyse University.
<a href="https://appsto.re/us/Pp4AM.i">Here is the iOS link</a>, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.precyseuniversity.icd10vcodebookb2b">here&#8217;s the Android link</a>. This app will set you back $7.99. It looks solid, with a wealth of information and ease of search. </p>

<p>The <em>MTBC ICD 9&#8211;10</em>/<em>ICD 9 to 10 converter</em> was also built for <a href="https://appsto.re/us/H799W.i">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mtbc.converter">Android</a> devices. I tried this one out and, though app store reviews were positive, I was underwhelmed. It doesn&#8217;t allow for code lookup by category. You can enter your specialty, and the app will pre-populate a list of common codes for that specialty. This would be kind of cool, but a notable absence among the few, pre-loaded specialties was some kind of psychiatry/mental/behavioral health listing. Ultimately, the only way I could access the &#8220;F&#8221; category of codes was to type in a given diagnosis. As such, I didn&#8217;t see this as an improvement over a straight, textbook &#8211; style lookup.</p>

<p><em>ICD10Doc - Diagnosis, Procedures and Billing codes</em> by Adam Scarlat has received a lot of positive ratings from its users. This is less an app, though, and more of a portal to a subscription-based service. Don&#8217;t let that be a dissuading factor, however, as the core service itself looks fairly robust. Check it out on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/icd10doc-diagnosis-procedures/id1022228475?mt=8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.appery.project137897">Android</a> for more information about pricing (available as monthly or yearly payments). </p>
