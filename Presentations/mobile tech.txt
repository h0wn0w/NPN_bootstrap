#Notes
- JINS 2012
	- Technology extends human ability.
	- Kapp 1877 defined technology as a direct morphological extension of human organs.
		- bows, catapults, bicycle, cars, computers
		- cognitve supports are ubiquitus: notebooks, diaries, calcjlators, abacus, alarm clocks, pen/paper, recipes, manuals
- Mobile devices such as smart phones have pretty immense capabilities. In essence, they are mobile computers.
	- Their connectivity to the internet allows them to be used as “assistive devices” in a number of different ways:
		- appointment reminders
		- navigation devices
		- memory “notebooks”
		- 
- There are plenty of apps that can be used to help individuals, with or without neurologic impairment, improve their everyday cognitive functions.
- These apps already exist.
- However, the usefulness of these apps are not studied empirically.
	- Success will likely be determined by severity of deficit and the potential physical limitations that can occur with some neurologic conditions.
		- Initial groups:
			- MCI/cerebrovascular disease
			- TBI
			- ADHD
- Resources

		- App domains
			- Education and School Tools
			- Medication reminders and Family Care
			- Planning and Organization
			- Military-related
				- PTSD symptoms and deep breathing

-Technology extends our ability 
-Physical examples
-Cognitive 
-Mobile tech allows us to travel time and space and has clear advantages for enhancing the effectiveness of everyday cognitive functioning in people with or without impairment
-Technology is developing at an accelerated rate...this is not linear, but logarithmic...our iPhones have more processing capabilities than computers that used to take up entire rooms. 
-kurzweil points out that we will merge with technology, instead of walking across campus to use a computer, we have one in our pocket. 
-technology is already used to support sensory functioning in people with sensorineural hearing loss and individuals who are paralyzed and have an electrode implanted can move cursors on a screen to communicate and even control a robot arm to make a cup of coffee. 
- deep brain stimulation is being used or studied to control seizures, Parkinsonian symptoms, depressive symptoms, OCD, pain, psychotic symptoms, memory loss?
- the merging has been happening. 
- higher order cognitive functioning and reverse engineering of intelligence is predicted to be much more advanced in 2020 than it is now. 7 years from now....2006 was seven years ago...I'm pretty sure leaving a voicemail for myself is less effective than telling Siri to remind me when I get close to my preferred grocery store to get milk!
- "wearable" technology - like google glass - watches - are merging technology with us and is the beginning of bringing thus to the masses. The so called 3rd half of our brain.
