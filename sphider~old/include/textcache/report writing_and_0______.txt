Author: W. Howard Buddin Jr., Ph.D. & S. Marc Testa, Ph.D. Category: Article Date: 08/03/2015 Tags: Advocacy, Report Writing, Tips Referral Question Neuropsychologists are known (read: notorious) for lengthy reports and high-latency report turnaround times. Why do we write such long damn reports? Or, maybe stated more aptly, why are we *taught* to write such long reports? Is it because we, as psychologists, must document the entirety of a person's life in the "four corners" of our report? Even if much of the information is not pertinent to the clinical question? Is it our job to summarize the complete medical record? Can we, as individual providers – or as a field – alter the traditions of report writing to be more practical? As conscientious clinicians, we should seek to improve the effectiveness and quality of our practice, overall, including our throughput (speed and number of reports completed). We all have reports that take longer than others, but the time involved in writing your report, should rarely — if ever — *delay* any treatment(s). Relevant History of Presenting Problem Median report lengths, according to Donders (2001b)[^4] (as reported by surveyed neuropsychologists) were five, six, and eight pages in Medical, Rehabilitative, and Private Practice settings, respectively. These numbers don't even reflect the typically poor [typography](http://neuropsychnow.com/2013/11/yourcallingcard) that characterizes many reports (10 pt. Arial font with very narrow margins anyone?). Data collected[^kp] for the [*Stakeholder's Project In Neuropsychological Report Writing*][sp] reveal that the average turnaround time for a clinical report is two weeks. Two weeks might be considered fast in some circles, but what about wait times for reports that exceed *four weeks*? Furthermore, respondents reported spending several hours writing reports that referral sources might not even read in their entirety. This last observation is likely unsurprising to many neuropsychologists. Social History There is a parallel between golf instruction and the teaching of certain neuropsychological responsibilities. We promise. Here it goes: if you're new to the game of golf, your instructor teaches you things like a correct grip, stance, backswing, etc. If you have been playing for a while, then their job is a bit different: they have to initially help you break old/bad habits before they can work on ingraining new/good habits. As it turns out, most “golf lessons” are actually just “hitting lessons.” *Hitting* lessons are fundamentally different from actual *golf* lessons. The former focuses on ball striking and other mechanics of the swing; the latter on things like planning one's approach, playing to the strengths of one's game, and how to play different shots from different lies, working around obstacles: "If the wind is in your face, club up one to keep from over-swinging; if your target is inside and the ball is above your feet, move your leading foot a little more up the slope, choke up on the club ; when you're around the green, look at the distance to the pin - do you want to bump and run, or flop the shot to drop close to the pin?" Put another way, golf lessons place emphasis on thinking more as a *player*, and less as a technician. Golf/playing lessons focus more on the *goal*, with a less rigid view of the individual steps needed to get there. The steps are important, to be sure, but we should not confuse one goal with another. In short, this is a different way to approach the *game* of golf. A successful approach is not about setting up, thinking about each component of the perfect swing[^ps]; it centers on *delivering the end result* and getting to the next target. As one last point, most people take *hitting lessons*; learning the *game* of golf is usually secondary. Now, let's replace the golf metaphor with broad ideals of neuropsychological education and training. There are "neuropsychological evaluation lessons" and "healthcare provider lessons." The former deals with the mechanics and art of the neuropsychologist's job, whereas the latter is *patient-centered* and goal-oriented. See what we did there? Educational History As graduate students, and later during internship and fellowship training, we are steeped in learning the finest points of the neuropsychological evaluation. I recall the slow progression towards truly internalizing specific knowledge points, like: 'how many individuals comprised the normative set for *Test X*?' or 'The 22^nd percentile corresponds to a Standard Score of 88 on the Normal Curve.' I don't, however, recall any particular emphasis being placed on understanding my role as *healthcare provider*. Perhaps this has become more germane as I have learned to engage my patients in more meaningful ways[^engage]. Either way, our training (necessarily) focuses on the flow of an evaluation and all that it entails. Once the evaluation is complete, it is not uncommon to never see the same patient again[^3]. Is *this* the reason that we so thoroughly document each patient's history? Indeed, there does not seem to be a universal rationale for *why* our reports are so long. Summary & Formulation I find [TED talks](https://www.ted.com/talks) mildly annoying.[^tg] Though possibly an unpopular position, there are [people][ted1] that more or less [share my sentiments][ted2]. In short, I dislike these talks because I feel like there is too much grandstanding, with too little in the actionable solutions department. Indeed, *implementing* solutions to any given problem is [much more challenging][sol] than *talking* about solutions. The point, here, is that this discussion is just another rant in the echo chamber without potentially viable solutions. Neuropsychological reports are long. Teaching students to write long reports has value, as it forces the consideration of many facets of a patient's life, and the subsequent consolidation of those facets into a narrative. We must then consider that narrative in the context of (a) the referral question and (b) neuropsychological testing results in order to arrive at a conclusion and answer a/the referral question(s). Beyond graduate school and training, however, generating a novella to answer a referral question is not always necessary. It may, in fact, be harmful to the patient (delay of treatment) and to your professional reputation ('Dr. X still hasn't gotten that report back to me. It's been weeks since my patient finished testing). Fortunately, the "problem" of reports being too long is one that has many solutions worth considering. So, let's talk about some fixes. Recommendations Given the goal of delivering optimal care, consider the following questions before/as you write your next report: * Does your average turnaround time delay treatment in any way? * Is it acceptable for patients and providers to wait weeks for treatment recommendations? * Is the patient getting appropriate and/or necessary care in the time between feedback and when they get the report? In closing, here are some final observations and thoughts: We *know* that most people are *not* reading our full reports, irrespective of audience.[^phy] So, why not provide an executive summary at the beginning? This way, the reader doesn't risk sustaining major paper cut injuries to get to the bottom line Alternatively, is it out of the question for us to write brief, bullet-point reports? Something akin to a progress note can sufficiently answer a referral question, taking up only a single page. There are several advantages to this latter approach. First, there is a time savings. This is addition by subtraction: we can effectively spend more time on direct, billable hours, rather than spending several hours writing a report, for which we are not being paid directly. Second, because the report would be inherently shorter, it could be written/dictated and delivered to the referring provider potentially on the *same day* of assessment. This means that recommendations for treatment could be delivered within 24 hours, say, instead of e.g. two (or more) weeks. Third, by writing shorter reports, we are more in line with other, similar fields' professional standards. A shorter report does not mean that we collected less information or based our opinions on scant information: it means simply that we are delivering the most pertinent information as a means to an expedient delivery of healthcare. At the end of the day, this is the reason why we spent all those years "learning the perfect swing," right? References Donders, J. (2001a).

See: *paralysis by analysis*. [^engage]: Which, if I am being honest, is likely a function of running my own practice. Since I am the sole driver of business to my doorstep and not a passive recipient of an institution-based referral system, I naturally focus on the business side of things more; I am more invested in all facets of my practice, because no one else will ever care about my business as much as I do. [^3]: Indeed, I am more or less in the habit of saying to patients as they leave the feedback session (jokingly, and with a smile): “I hope I never see you again."  [^phy]: Forensic reports are the likely exception to this rule. Physicians, however, are generally not interested in anything other than the answer to the referral question. [^tg]: *Every* TED talk is tagged on the [talks page](https://www.ted.com/talks) as either “Informative” or "Inspiring." Since every talk is labeled as one of these two, it seems that they are sort of useless categorizations.

[1] That’s why we’re counting on input from those of you reading this site. It’s how we’ll grow in a way unlike any other resource. So, we’re accepting submissions for any information that you think others would benefit from (such as a link or original content). We can’t/won’t/don’t publish every single thing that we find or that comes our way, though. We do our best to make sure that everything we distribute is of the highest quality possible and is vetted to some degree. Ultimately, we aspire to use the same principles and criteria to vet content as the peer-review process. Not everything will make it up to the World Wide Webs.

Articles should generally be kept to around 500 words. You may submit an article about anything related to the field of neuropsychology that you believe others might find interesting. [2] If we select your original work for inclusion, we’ll put your name at the header of the article and a short bio at the end. So, if you send us an article, please send a 50-word bio as well. Any longer than 50 words and we will edit it to our liking. Original articles should be in either a common word processor (e.g., .rtf , .doc , .docx ) or plain text (e.g., .txt , .md ) file type.

Not convinced that easy access to the most current information is important? Consider this quote from Alexander & Roberts (1998): “The field of clinical psychology is diverse and informational material continually becomes available in a multitude of places. Because the half-life of psychological knowledge is brief, the need for updating and accessing resources is nearly constant for both researchers and practitioners alike.” [1] Kristi Alexander, Michael C.

Thanks and Support Neuropsych Now thanks all of the developers of the aforementioned components for their hard work, without which this site would look and function very differently, and not in a good way. One-hundred percent of the code used to construct this site is open source , meaning that it is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and re-distribute. The impetus for the open source movement was the simple idea that things would move along much more quickly if an unrestricted number of individuals were allowed to contribute to original projects. This philosophy quickly spread and has led to an incredible advancement in software development as a result. The inception and ongoing mission of Neuropsych Now is, in part, an attempt to perpetuate and extend that philosophy to the field of neuropsychology by encouraging and allowing like-minded individuals to easily draw from, and contribute to, a collective knowledge source.

Howard Buddin Jr., Ph.D. Content: Article Date: 10/30/2013 Tags: Practice, Productivity, Reports, Screencast, Workflow, Writing Writing in plain text is, to us, largely superior to using a full-blown word processor. Plain text *files* are lightweight and versatile. Plain text *editors* are, relative to most word processors, free of questionably useful features, leaving a distraction-free writing environment. In one of our [previous screencasts](http://neuronow.com/2013/08/gettingreportsdone_2), we demonstrated some of the benefits of writing reports with [TextExpander for Mac](http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html). In case it isn't clear, we think writing with plain text is great.[^1] Unfortunately, the sample size of neuropsychologists writing reports in plain text is probably n = 2. That means that the aforementioned screencast, while clearly *incredibly* fun to watch, may not have been that useful to you. This screencast is our attempt to make something that appeals to others - *any* others: we used Microsoft Word as the writing platform. Everyone uses Word, so it made sense to show how we use it, too. The expansion snippet shown here is *much* more advanced/complex than the one from the previous TextExpander screencast; it has evolved. While it took a lot of effort to get it working well in MS Word, it affords incredible flexibility. Ultimately, you need only this one snippet to replace all the templates in your arsenal. Writing a peds report or geriatric evaluation? It doesn't matter. This is cohort/referral question agnostic. At least the *method* is, if not the snippet. The snippet evolves with your needs. More on that in an as-yet-to-be-written article. Oh, yeah, one last thing. Among our goals here at Neuropsych Now are to save you time and effort, and to get resources to you for free, when possible.

Howard Buddin Jr., Ph.D. Web: http://neuropsychnow.com Date: 07/10/2013 Tags: Applications, Mac, Productivity, Reports, Writing, Tech, Word We've [talked before] about our relative disdain for Microsoft Word. The grim reality (for us, anyway) is that most institutions still expect to get and receive reports that are composed in Word. Such is the way. All hope is not lost, though, even if you're working on a locked-down Dell PC on which you can neither add nor delete software. We've also [covered text expansion before], but that was using an application that was made for that specific purpose. One of our favorite tricks for getting Word to play nice and make report writing faster is to "trick it" into doing text expansion. This means that you type one or two keystrokes, and "Presto!" The result is anything from one word to an entire report template Here's how it works. [^1] How To: The Basics 1. Open up Word's "Preferences" (Mac OS X) or "Options" (Windows) menu. 2. Select the "AutoCorrect" tab from the available menu options. You'll see two blank fields as shown in the screenshot below: "Replace:" and "With:". While these are already pre-populated with the default Word settings, you are free to add your own. This is, in our experience, not common knowledge. ![Word's Preferences/Options Menu][exec] 3. Think of a word or phrase that you frequently type, like "executive functioning." This is going to be your target. Now, think of a short way to express that, preferably in a way that is sane and easy to remember. This will be your "shortcut" that you'll type instead of the word(s). Here, we'll use ";ef" (the `;` is prepended to set it apart from other words that begin with "ef," such as "effort"). Type that in the "Replace:" field. Now, type "executive functioning" in the "With:" field. ![Entering Fields][fields] 4. Click "Add" followed by "OK" (or "Apply" for Windows users). That's it Next time you type out ";ef" it will expand automatically to read "executive functioning." This trick can be expanded on to include anything you would rather not type, including *entire, formatted report sturctures*, headings and all. Here's how to get that to work. How To: Advanced 1. Open up a Word document and type out the text you want to have expanded. Let's use a signature line as an example. 2. Now select the text you've just typed. 3. Open Word's preferences/options as described above, and select the "AutoCorrect" tab. This time, however, you'll see that the "Formatted Text" radio button is selected and the "With:" field has been populated with your formatted signature line ![Formatted Text Replacement][format] 4. Enter whatever key combination you'd like to use as your shortcut (short and easy to remember are optimal), then apply the changes. Done and done.

Howard Buddin Jr., Ph.D. Category: Article Date: 12/18/2013 Tags: Assessment, Practice, Testing Making Candles I've had several ideas over the past few years about how I might shoehorn some, or all, of a battery of tests onto my computer. Most of these involved scanning stimulus book pages and rendering them as high resolution images for display on a laptop. This, I thought, would be especially useful for tests with items that are presented for only a few seconds before the next item is shown (e.g., the TOMM). I wanted to do things this way largely because I was frustrated with administering tests in a manner that had effectively remained unchanged for literally decades (or centuries, for that matter). It felt like a case of arrested development and stagnation in the field of neuropsychology. Other healthcare disciplines seem to have surpassed us by implementing technology to improve patient care. In fact, I can't remember the last time my PCP *wasn't* actively using a tablet to record pertinent medical information and review past records while in the room with me. If not in actuality, then at least in pretense, my primary healthcare doc seems to be keeping up and moving forward with the latest advances in technology. I like that; maybe it's just me, though. The question, then, was *what in the world was keeping neuropsychological test development stuck in the past?* Love, Hate I am of two minds when it comes to neuropsychology's relationship with the publishing industry. 1. I appreciate the infrastructure that they bring to the table. Like it or not, large-scale production to meet the needs of an industry isn't free. The resources needed for test development, publication of texts, journals, etc., and their subsequent mass distribution, are far in excess of what even a committed group can reasonably muster.[^paradigm] 2. I dislike the relationship between our field and the publishing industry at-large. We are dependent upon them to the point that we almost *cannot exist without them*. Despite my feelings in either direction, I have to say that I was excited when Pearson decided to develop tablet-administered versions of some of their/our most commonly used tests. This Is Not Your Grandparents' Neuropsychological Assessment Late last year, [Pearson] (aka Pearson Education, Inc., aka Pearson Clinical, aka PsychCorp) released the [Q-Interactive platform](http://www.helloq.com/home.html). Briefly, Q-Interactive is "a comprehensive digital platform" that allows for clinicians to create and manage patient data and batteries of testing instruments. With this release, Pearson both instituted a sea-change in the way we administer tests and laid out a roadmap for [what they see as the future of assessment](http://www.helloq.com/overview/our-vision.html). You can learn more about Q-Interactive's features by visiting the [product landing page]. Naturally, I wanted to learn more about the platform and tests. To the Internet I went. Interestingly, there was almost no information about the Q-Interactive platform outside of the official product pages. This is probably due, at least partially, to a few factors that are common to new, niche-market releases (e.g., newness of the platform, seemingly relative low rate of adoption by clinicians). Despite the lack of third-party reviews, I decided to march forward anyway, and signed up for the [30-day trial]. Initial Steps: Hardware and Software Requirements Please note: this article cannot cover all of the various aspects of Q-Interactive, so I'll focus on what stood out most to me, in addition to covering the most obvious, major factors of this paradigm-changing (yet pleasantly familiar) system. The Hardware I needed two iPads before signing up for the trial. One trip to my local Apple store and just under $1,000 later, I was set to go. [^cost] The cost of the price of admission (roughly $900 for two of Apple's [second generation iPads] and two iPad [Smart Cases]) paled in comparison to the collective costs of purchasing [several] of the [testing](http://www.pearsonclinical.com/psychology/products/100000618/deliskaplan-executive-function-system-d-kefs.html#pricing) [kits] that Q-Interactive's product pool covers. This is an amazing boon for people like me (only months into private practice): I was able to get up and running with a very respectable arsenal of tests at the ready for relatively *very* little money up front. As a side note, I observed that Pearson is doing an objectively bad job marketing this idea, if not the Q-Interactive platform as a whole. One of the more recent emails I received touted "Goodbye stopwatches" as though this should be a major selling point of adopting Q-Interactive. Saying goodbye to stopwatches isn't really a great value-added proposition, at least not for me. There are many other things I care about, like reliability, validity, ease of administration, security, and more. Enough about that, though let's get back to the hardware. ![Saying goodbye to stopwatches: a value-added proposition?][1] Q-Interactive runs on any second generation or newer iPad. It also is compatible with iOS 7, Apple's most recent release of their mobile operating system. I have Q-Interactive on a pair of iPad 2's running iOS 7, and things seem to be fine. More recently, Pearson announced that the iPad Mini and iPad Air could be used as well, with the former restricted to clinician use only. Pearson also says that you need a stylus for administration. I have found that this is true only if you plan on making behavioral observations *within* the application interface; a "notes" button is on each screen/page to afford quickly launching a full-screen canvas on which one can take said notes. It is *very* helpful if you're going to record verbatim responses for each verbal item, but is, again, not a necessity, per se. For me, writing legibly with pen and paper is already a tenuous proposition. Turns out, writing on the iPad results in poorly-formed glyphs that are an order of magnitude worse. Your mileage may vary in that department, but one thing is clear: you *do not need a stylus* to administer the Q-Interactive tests. None that I encountered, at least. The Software and Interfaces The [Q-Interactive app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/q-interactive/id543319804?mt=8) is fairly well thought out for a first generation product. The experiences I've had to date have been positive, overall, and I'm far more impressed than not. Interestingly, on one of the occasions that I spoke with Pearson's technical support, I asked if they would register me for any future beta-testing. The rep informed me that they had performed *no beta testing* with actual, real neuropsychologists using their product. I was dubious; he re-asserted: no public beta testing. This was shocking to me, since pretty much any software developer will want to test their product before its public release, and they do this by recruiting a select group of individuals and asking them to try out the product and (hopefully) help catch any remaining bugs.[^beta] Speaking of bugs I have, on a few occasions, received an error message during the post-evaluation scoring of Symbol Search and Coding. Basically, since you cannot score these two subtests during the administration[^1], you return later to add in the scores that you calculated by hand. The error message tells me that I am running out of memory on my iPad, and the operation cannot be performed. The popup dialog offers a "solution," to access the function from one of the other interface menus, but it doesn't work. That it didn't work was not surprising to me, given the way that iOS manages memory and applications. In short, it's damn near impossible to "run out of memory" on an iOS device, particularly one that is brand new, has no applications running in the background, and has almost no other software installed. I recently contacted Pearson's technical support about the error message and received a somewhat lukewarm, if not reassuring, response that "there's always a fix." I have sent in the error logs from my iPad as the tech requested, and I am actually pretty sure that they'll call back. I have been impressed with their customer service to date their reps have been attentive, helpful and, dare I say, friendly. As for fixing the problem: [Force quitting like any other iOS 7 app](http://ios.wonderhowto.com/how-to/completely-close-out-running-applications-iphone-ios-7-save-battery-0147375/ "How to Completely Close Out Running Applications in iPhone iOS 7 ") has worked for me 100% of the time.[^fix] One of the nicest aspects of the Q-Interactive experience is the on-the-fly scoring: tests that are administered using only the iPads are totally scored once the end of the subtest is reached. The benefits of this should be clear to most, but they're worth outlining anyway. First, the potential error associated with hand scoring is reduced substantially. There is still room for error, to be sure, as you can easily select the incorrect score for an item; however, the likelihood of such an error is small, and there is the opportunity to review all scores after you have administered a subtest. A second benefit is the reduction in scoring time. Scoring something like a WAIS-IV by hand isn't particularly difficult, but it does take time, and you quickly reach a point where scoring any faster is either not possible or could lead to mistakes. As the tests are scored as you go, scoring time is reduced to the length of time needed to score e.g., Digit Symbol Coding and Symbol Search on the WAIS-IV, or Visual Reproduction on the WMS-IV. The final, substantial benefit comes with the scoring output. Once scoring is complete, you must "remove" (a poorly chosen word relative to what actually takes place) the battery of tests from the iPad and then log into [qiactive.com](http://qiactive.com) to download the results. I can see this being a pain point for some, but really there is no other way they could deliver the results in a persistent, secure fashion. Besides, it's really not that hard, and you have to log into the site to manage patient information, anyways. The output can be brief (just the primary Indexes and Scale Scores) or extensive (the Kitchen Sink). The latter of the two provides scores and data that are not possible to obtain using the traditional, hand-scored approach *or* the scoring assistant software. I actually used one data point, total time of administration for a WISC-IV, in a recent feedback and report. I knew the testing took a long time (ended up being 93 minutes, some of which I allowed for qualitative, observational data), but I didn't realize it had taken quite *that* long. Bonus Round Pearson sweetens the pot in two ways when you sign up and pay for the annual license. 1. They send you a "starter kit" with packets of protocols, response booklets, and other supplies like templates, blocks, etc. The package is substantial and generous, but if you are thinking about taking the plunge, think *quickly*: the starter kits are free only through the end of 2013. Tick, tock. 2. You don't pay for any of the subtests you give for the first 30 days *after* subscribing and paying the annual license. That means you get 30 days of free administrations during the trial period *and* another 30 days after your initial annual commitment. ![Templates and sundry supplies][2] ![Protocols and response booklets][3] The (Lack of) Normative Data The biggest, most egregious problem with Q-Interactive is the utter lack of new, updated normative data for *any* of the tests. Pearson self-published some equivalency studies that seek to demonstrate evidence of construct validity, but these are clearly biased and have shamefully small n's to boot. They currently have six of these equivalency studies available for download on their [research page](http://www.helloq.com/research.html). It's far too much information to review here, so please review these studies for yourself. I've so far administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale – IV (WAIS – IV), the Wechsler Memory Scale – IV (WMS-IV), the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children – IV (WISC – IV), the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test - III (WIAT-III), portions of the Delis Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS), and the California Verbal Learning Test – II (CVLT-II). At the end of the day, I can tell you that I believe these tests are measuring their respective constructs just as validly as their traditional counterparts. My gut feeling, though, has yet to be borne out by real data. Paul Meehl taught us all a lesson about that many years ago, so I will not rely on my own beliefs quite yet. Summary and First Impressions The Q-Interactive system represents a needed update to a dated and tired method of test administration. It offers a way for neuropsychologists to streamline their practice by minimizing the materials needed to administer tests, and affords *mobility*, versus the customary, usually necessary, testing at one location. The tests are scored almost immediately, and can be downloaded for archiving or databasing. The upfront costs are low, compared to the same number of tests purchased in their traditional, paper-pencil-protocol formats. Importantly, there is another cost, although it's not of the monetary ilk: questionable validity, mostly due to the lack of true normative data. So ends this gross overview of the Q-Interactive system. If you have the means (i.e., two iPads), sign up for the trial; see what you think. Based on my experiences thus far, it's unlikely that I'll ever turn back it would feel like eschewing light bulbs for making candles.

The Smart Cases were, in hindsight, a poorly chosen product. They do what they're supposed to do, but in the testing environment you'll want something that can securely prop up the iPad at various angles, which is where the Smart Cases come up short. [^1]: Assuming that you are properly scoring each item, all of the subtest Scaled Scores are generated in real-time, and you can see the SS upon completion of each subtest. [^fix]: By the way, if you use are having the same problem with Q-Interactive and this fix works for you, please make sure to ascribe credit to the appropriate party: this guy, not Pearson.

[^beta]: And then I found this: “The clinicians who participated in our public beta agree: The launch of Q-interactive truly represents a groundbreaking turning point for interactive clinical assessments,” said Linda Gerardi, director of Q-interactive at Pearson " So, the developer, who develops the applications for Pearson that need developing, was either (1) not completely forthright (2) somehow misinformed into believing that beta testers were all "in house," or (3) patently out of the loop. You cannot be a software developer, whose job is to refine a product during beta testing, and not know where and from whom bug reports are eminating.

Though computerized scoring programs (e.g., WAIS-IV Scoring Assistant, Q-Local) make scoring a protocol easy, there may be an additional need to format the output. This screencast demonstrates how to use Excel to "grab" data scored by a scoring program (in this case the Calibrated Neuropsychological Normative System-Software Portfolio; [CNNS-SP](http://www4.parinc.com/Products/Product.aspx?ProductID=CNNS)) and to generate a figure that can be used during a team discussion or pasted into the body of the final report itself.

Howard Buddin Jr., Ph.D. Date: 08/07/2013 Tags: Dictation, Practice, Productivity, Reports, Screencast, Workflow The Intake I like to try and dictate everything from an intake interview immediately after it's over. This is basically just what Dr. Testa described in the ["Getting Reports Done" article](../07/gettingreportsdone.html). Since the iPhone has dictation capability buiit in, I can use it to dictate straight to a blank document. Of course, when I dictate, I substitute any Protected Health Information with pseudonyms or placeholders. Personally, I use the names of famous people in place of the actual name, and substitute any personal information such as place of birth with placeholders like "City, State". Once I'm finished dictating, I save the file into a directory that is synchronized to my desk top computer with [Dropbox][7354-001], and it's now ready to be inserted into a separate file that is used specifically for that patient's report. A couple of quick notes about dictation of this type: first, it is not pretty, nor is it intended to be. The important thing is that I am dictating from my notes immediately after finishing the intake. This way, the information is absolutely fresh in my mind. The other thing I've found is that things go much more smoothly if I dictate as kind of a stream of thought. So, although I try to follow through in my dictation in the same order that information will appear in the report, I don't stick to this hard and fast. My dictations are full of colloquialisms, misspoken words, and redundancies. This was really hard for me to do at first, since I wanted to dictate something that was going to nearly approximate a finished product; however, I found that if I just dictated in a more conversational manner that the information came out much more like a narrative, which is what I wanted. Report Setup So, now that I have dictated all the information from the intake, whether it is in a pretty format or not, I need to do something with it. So, the next step is to get it into its own document. I can't just leave it in that synchronized file, since replacing my placeholders with PHI would be a violation of the [HIPAA Privacy Rule][7354-002] This is where I use my other favorite report writing tool: [TextExpander][7354-003]. For many years I used a Microsoft word document template to start each report. This is still a great way to work, but I replaced it with TextExpander and a blank plain text file, which is something that works much better for me. For a quick example of what text expander can do, take a quick look at our previous article about using it to create a mental status section. Briefly, text expander allows one to type a small set of characters, which are then "expanded" into a word, phrase, or even an entire report template. I started by taking words I often used and created snippets with them. Words like "neuropsychological," "neurocognitive," and "hypertension" were good first targets. I quickly moved on to longer phrases, like "Durable Power of Attorney" and "The patient's medical history is positive for". Here are the abbreviations for each of these, in order: `,nl` = neuropsychological `,ng` = neurocognitive `htn` = hypertension `,dpa` = Durable Power of Attorney `mdhx` = The patient's medical history is positive for The next step to all of this is creating a kind of dynamic system for generating the structure (and *some* of the content) for an entire neuropsychological report. For an outpatient report, I open a blank document (no template files required!) and I use Text Expander to start out each one of my reports by typing the following: `,skelout` Watch the screencast below to see what happens next, and how I use this workflow to get my reports going with relative ease.

Marc Testa, Ph.D. Web: http://neuropsychnow.com Date: 08/27/2013 Tags: Applications, Dictation, Practice, Productivity, Reports, Tech, Writing, Workflow ![][dictamus] Many psychologists use dictation software. Dragon NaturallySpeaking (on the PC) or Dragon Dictate (for Mac OS) are probably the most popular. These dictation software packages transform speech to text, in real time. That is, as you speak into a microphone, words appear on a computer screen. There is, however, a somewhat neglected feature these packages offer called transcription . Transcription allows you to record an audio file of your own speech that can be converted to text at a later point in time. Currently, the accuracy of Dragon's transcription feature is quite high and should, therefore, be considered something to add to your report writing workflow. "So do I need to buy an audio recorder?" No, because if you own a mobile phone, you probably already have what you need Nuance (the makers of Dragon products) offers a [free voice recording app](http://www.nuance.com/dragon/recorder-app/index.htm) for iPhone users (they also have an [app](http://www.nuance.com/dragon/remote-microphone/index.htm) that turns your iOS or Android phone into a dictation microphone). Though Nuance does not offer a voice recorder app for Android users, [there are free options available](http://www.attorneyatwork.com/dictation-apps-for-android-lawyers/). Though these apps allow you to share the file in various ways, most, however, do not have encryption capabilities. This is important due to [HIPAA HiTech rules](http://blogs.computerworld.com/cloud-security/22647/can-you-be-hipaa-compliant-cloud) that address PHI "in the cloud". You could attach your phone to your computer, but that would be so 2005 For iOS users, one very acceptable solution is [Dictamus](https://itunes.apple.com/app/dictamus-dictate-send/id305870342?mt=8), which allows you to send a an encrypted audio file using a number of methods (Android options are [here](http://androidapp.lisisoft.com/android-apps/voice-recorder-with-encryption.html)). For instance, you can have the file uploaded to DropBox, which (after decrypting) can be accessed using Dragon software on your main computer. (Note: Decryption is easiest with this [app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dictamus-decrypter/id530174469?mt=12) but free options are also available). In sum, consider using the transcription feature that is built into Dragon. It provides an accurate way to produce content and, moreover, there are great solutions that allow you to use your mobile phone to record and send audio files securely . Future posts will include a workflow that combines the benefits of transcription with the magic of [text expansion](http://neuropsychnow.com/2013/08/gettingreportsdone_2).

Marc Testa, PhD  Date: 10/05/2013 Tags: Excel, Data, Presentation, Report Writing Sometimes, to make Excel do what you want, you have to be creative. This article reviews more details of the spreadsheet used in this [screencast], including the use of a "glass" scatterplot, conditional formatting, and macros. The actual spreadsheet can be downloaded [here].[^1] To understand what is happening in this spreadsheet, it is important to realize that there is a "glass" or see-through scatterplot placed directly over Column D in the "Results Overview" spreadsheet. The cells of Column D use conditionally formatted "data bars" so that values greater than a T-score of 50 or less than a T-score of 30 are highlighted blue and red, respectively. Scatterplot The Excel spreadsheet used in the previous [screencast] was informed partially by this [article](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/5/52). Basically, the graph is a scatterplot in which only the values plotted against the horizontal axis (the T-scores) are meaningful (see Column G, "Results Overview" spreadsheet). The values on the vertical axis (Column N, "Results Overview" spreadsheet) are place holders that simply help align the data points to the appropriate row. The scatterplot is made "clear" by selecting "No Fill" in the properties of both the "Plot Area" and the "Chart Area." ![Figure 1. Formatting Graph to "No Fill"] Conditional Formatting The cells of Column D use conditional formatting. If you go to cell D12 and use the menu `Format Conditional Formatting`, you can begin to see how to use conditional formatting. More options are accessible from the Home tab of Excel's tool bar ribbon. Microsoft's [Excel Blog](http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-excel/archive/2009/08/07/data-bar-improvements-in-excel-2010.aspx) is a good place to start learning more about conditional formatting options. Macros Only three macros are used in the spreadsheet. The first pastes data from the clipboard into the spreadsheet. The second macro saves a `.pdf` version of the data table to the desktop. The third clears the workbook for the next patient's data. To learn more about how to write or record macros, search the internet You can probably find sample code to get you started. In this particular workbook, however, the macros can be accessed by going to `Tools Macros`. So, What Does This Have to Do With Neuropsychology? Good question. Three answers: 1. *Communication.* It is vital that a clinical neuropsychologist relay information to patients, their family, and other healthcare providers in a manner that is clear and concise. The table produced by this workbook is meant to communicate information succinctly. It is used during team meetings and in the final clinical report. 2. *Efficiency.* Fast report turnaround time makes *everybody* happy. 3. *Billing.* The faster reports are finished, the more patients can be seen in a given period of time. Note About the Battery This particular battery is used as a brief dementia screen. Most of the measures can be scored using the Calibrated Neuropsychological Normative System ([CNNS-SP]). The only components of the battery that are not part of the CNNS-SP include Go/No-Go and the 2- and 3-D drawings (i.e., a cross and a house). [Figure 1.

Author: W. Howard Buddin Jr., Ph.D. & S. Marc Testa, Ph.D. Category: Article Date: 11/15/2013 Tags: Practice, Report Writing, Typography Consider the following idea: a neuropsychologist's report is their calling card. The idea is that your report goes out to the world; it's your emissary. We could extend it a bit further, though, and say that *everything* with which your name is associated and/or over which you have/had some control is your calling card. This might include Web sites, research, and public speaking appearances. As a quick test, head over to your favorite search engine and Google/Bing/DDG [^1] yourself. What do the results look like? Keeping in mind that this is *exactly* what anyone who looks for you would see, are you okay with the results? You certainly can't control everything about how the public perceives you, but you *can* control just about everything that you produce especially your reports. In this post, we'd like to talk about something that most neuropsychologists have probably never considered: *typography*. We have found that typography is an important subject in many fields, including several sciences. So, what is typography, exactly? "Typography is the visual component of the written word." That quote was pulled From “[What is Typography]", which is part of the excellent, concise typography primer [Butterick’s Practical Typography][1]. We have read his guide from wire-to-wire, and cannot say enough about it. More on that in just a bit. First, though, let's address something that you might be wondering: why does typography matter? Isn't it the *content* of my report that is most important? Well, yes. Mostly. Consider the following scenario, which plays out all the time. You're interviewing candidates for a job/fellowship/internship. You've made your way down to the final two, both of whom are equally skilled, etc. You lay the C.V.s out side-by-side. One uses MS Word default settings (12pt. Times New Roman, et al.), with lengthy, tightly spaced lines that make reading a chore. The other candidate, however, took the time to create a neat, readable C.V., that was typeset with [LaTeX], and that used a [custom Serif font-face] that she had purchased. Of the two, which candidate would you be most likely to choose (again, with all other factors being improbably equal)? Probably the person who appears to have put in some extra effort, without being over-the-top. Heuristics would almost demand that the second candidate is sensibly detail-oriented, has, or knows how to access, uncommon skill sets or resources, and demonstrates an appreciation for how others view her work. So, if you might choose a candidate based on the attention to detail that they put forth on a C.V., might someone else not evaluate *your* work similarly? A little bit of good typography could make the difference. Again, take a look at [Butterick's guide][1]. You might be surprised to learn that a [tab stop] is not when you've been cut off by the bartender, and that [widow and orphan control] is, well not what it sounds like it is.

Marc Testa, Ph.D. Date: 07/29/2013 Tags: Dictation, Productivity, Reports, Workflow S. Marc Testa, Ph.D. Every once in a while, it's a good idea to consider if you are working as efficiently as possible. If you are prone to tinkering, however, this can be tricky business. *Trying to improve your productivity does not mean you are being more productive.* When is it reasonable to spend time critiquing your own workflow to see how you can improve? For trainees, the perfect opportunity is between clinical placements. For practicing clinicians, consider using a an hour each night over a long weekend to examine your report writing process. There are various aspects to consider including: - Acceptable turnaround time - Protecting time to write - Actual process of writing - Content and report length - Implementation of new technology, e.g. dictation, spreadsheets or scoring software Acceptable Turnaround & Protecting Writing Time This is a topic that almost every neuropsychologist I talk to struggles with to some degree. In my own process, I've realized I can complete an entire assessment in one day, even if I am administering the test battery. To do this, I organize my interview and interview paperwork, in the same order that they will appear in the final report. This allows me to read my interview sheet and dictate the history and behavioral observations fairly easily. Although dictation is fast and makes report writing much easier, it is best to dictate as soon as possible. When possible, I will have a patient complete a self-report inventory after the interview, so I can dictate the history immediately. Once testing is completed, I score the battery and create a table for the report. This can be time consuming, but doesn't have to be. I've been successful in using excel-based scoring sheets that "grabs" test data from a standardized scoring program (e.g., [the CNNS from PAR, Inc.](http://www4.parinc.com/Products/Product.aspx?ProductID=CNNS)) and creates a formatted report-ready table that can be pasted into an electronic medical record. The next step is to dictate the remaining sections including the Review of Findings (i.e. the "Results") and the Formulation and Recommendations. When physicians have a clinic, they seem to get all their reports completed that day or the next. Neuropsychologists? Not so much. Why is this? It is likely that some academic and research oriented clinicians may perceive that they can interview a patient and then go to a meeting or focus on writing a paper and eventually get back to writing the report for that patient at some other time. Chances are, the so-called "other time" is not well-defined, and efficiency suffers as a result. In my own practice, whenever I make it a point to finish a report for the patient I see that day, my overall turnaround improves. Moreover, I am better able to attend to other, non-clinical tasks. Content and Report Length Do you know how referral sources read your report? My bet is that most skip to the Formulation and do not even read the history. It is more likely that a document of 3 or 4 pages will be read as compared to one that is 7, 8 or 20 pages long. It's also helpful to ask yourself if a lengthy report will be *clinically* useful or not. Implementation of New Technology Using new technology is fun. Some technology can help improve your work product drastically. Other technologies have that promise, but do not work out in the end. Start slowly and don't get too immersed in the tinkering that will potentially be a big waste of time. At the end of the day, our goal as neuropsychologists is to provide efficient patient care. Taking time once or twice a year to review and critique your workflow, and talk to others about theirs, could benefit you and your patients in the long run.";s:4:"size";s:4:"3.83";s:13:"click_counter";s:1:"0";s:6:"weight";i:7;s:4:"shot";s:0:"";s:6:"domain";s:1:"1";s:11:"domain_name";s:12:"neuronow.com";s:4:"path";s:9:"/2013/07/";s:9:"maxweight";i:46;s:7:"results";i:26;s:2:"db";s:1:"1";s:10:"title_priv";s:14:"Neuropsych Now";s:9:"desc_priv";s:0:"";}i:25;a:16:{s:5:"title";s:14:"Neuropsych Now";s:11:"description";s:0:"";s:3:"url";s:59:"http://neuronow.com/2013/10/PlainTextDataTableAutomationEMR";s:7:"fulltxt";s:1194:"Title: Plain Text Data Table Automation for EMRs Author: S. Marc Testa, Ph.D. Web: http://neuropsychnow.com Date: 10/07/13 Tags: excel, report writing, data tables, automation Electronic medical records (EMR) have been used at various institutions for quite some time, but are becoming more prevalent. The VA hospital has been at the forefront of this movement. The attached spreadsheet was developed to generate a formatted data table that could be used in the CPRS, the default EMR at the VA. Though it has not been used outside of CPRS, it is likely that the data table created by this spreadsheet can be used in most electronic medical records. This particular [spreadsheet] generates a plaintext file using the native Windows application "Notepad.exe." Over time, a Mac OS version will be developed. This spreadsheet captures data calculated by the Calibrated Neuropsychological Normative System's Software Portfolio ([CNNS-SP]) and also has the capability of incorporating clinician-entered PAI data. There are macros embedded into the spreadsheet that can be viewed by going to `Tools Macros`. [spreadsheet]: LINK???
