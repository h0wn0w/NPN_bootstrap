<p>Consider the following statements: </p>

<ol>
<li>I enjoy reading about/doing/analyzing statistics.</li>
<li>I am in private practice.</li>
</ol>

<p>These two things are at odds with one another. In private practice, one doesn&#8217;t really get to engage in research as often as they would in a hospital or university setting. I am in private practice, and <em>withdrawal</em> is the best way to describe my plight. All that said, I was super excited and satiated last night as I read through &#8220;Use of Latent Class Analysis to define groups based on validity, cognition, and emotional functioning&#8221; by Ruth T. Morin and Bradley N. Axelrod. It was a solid article, and addresses one of those &#8220;we all know it&#8217;s a thing but the primary-source material isn&#8217;t really there&#8221; conundrums. </p>

<p>I <em>was</em> going to go on and on about how much we all understand the inherent strengths and weaknesses in using certain cutoff scores in certain ways (particularly across separately-normed batteries), etc., etc. A better idea, though, is for you to download one of only a few copies, right <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/XPwtngZVMHsxz6DrurBs/full">here</a>.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Dr. Axelrod for sharing this with the neuropsychology community! Also, if <em>you</em> and your colleagues have a new article that you&#8217;d like to share with everyone, <a href="mailto:admin@neuropsychnow.com">drop us a line</a>.</p>
