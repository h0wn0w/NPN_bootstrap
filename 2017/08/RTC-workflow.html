<p>Setting up follow-up visits is not exactly an unsolved problem. The way it typically happens (e.g., patient takes another trip to the front desk, or calls back later &#8212; hopefully &#8212; to set up a visit for some weeks or months into the future) works, for the most part, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it is necessarily the most <em>efficient</em> way to do it. I have it set up for my private practice so that the aforementioned process is eliminated, freeing up my office manager&#8217;s time &#8212; and taking only a fraction of mine &#8212; to do more improtant things. </p>

<p>I use the following workflow to add patients to my practice calendar, so that they get a call to scheule either a six- or 12-month return to clinic/follow up visit. I love it, because I can add their and it shows up in 23 weeks (for a six-month follow-up) or 50 weeks (for a 12-month follow-up), cueing my office manager to call the patient (or their caregiver, parent, etc.) and schedule the appointment.</p>

<p>I built this workflow using two iOS apps: <a href="https://www.workflow.is">Workflow</a> and <a href="https://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/">Launch Center Pro</a>. </p>

<p>Here is how it works:</p>

<figcaption>Next, type in their name, and tap &#8220;OK&#8221; </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Done. Like magic.</p>

<p>Behind-the-scenes is a relatively simple series of steps. </p>

<p>That&#8217;s all there is to it. Ridiculously efficient.</p>

<p>Like most components of my workflows and organizational system, this helps me to both get more work done in a shorter period of time and it keeps me from dropping the ball a lot more often.</p>
