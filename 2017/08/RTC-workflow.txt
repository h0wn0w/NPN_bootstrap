Setting up follow-up visits is not exactly an unsolved problem. The way it typically happens (e.g., patient takes another trip to the front desk, or calls back later — hopefully — to set up a visit for some weeks or months into the future) works, for the most part, but that doesn't mean it is necessarily the most *efficient* way to do it. I have it set up for my private practice so that the aforementioned process is eliminated, freeing up my office manager's time — and taking only a fraction of mine — to do more improtant things. 

I use the following workflow to add patients to my practice calendar, so that they get a call to scheule either a six- or 12-month return to clinic/follow up visit. I love it, because I can add their and it shows up in 23 weeks (for a six-month follow-up) or 50 weeks (for a 12-month follow-up), cueing my office manager to call the patient (or their caregiver, parent, etc.) and schedule the appointment.

I built this workflow using two iOS apps: [Workflow] and [Launch Center Pro]. 

Here is how it works:

![Next, type in their name, and tap "OK"  ][modal_confirm]

Done. Like magic.

Behind-the-scenes is a relatively simple series of steps.

That's all there is to it. Ridiculously efficient.

Like most components of my workflows and organizational system, this helps me to both get more work done in a shorter period of time and it keeps me from dropping the ball a lot more often.
