<p>We&#8217;ve all had the experience of proofreading reports on a monitor only to find an error in the printed report. Among a number of factors, document fatigue may be responsible for this. The &#8220;flow&#8221; of a report can also suffer as a result. To break up the monotony, some strategies can be employed, including printing the document. </p>

<p>Additionally, one can alter the modality of the report by using text-to-speech functions in order to listen to the report. Though one could read along while viewing the document on screen, following along using a printed version of the report alters the report&#8217;s modality even further. Use a pen and to track edits easily.</p>

<p>Here are links to instructions for setting up text-to-speech on <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/PH14230">Apple</a> and <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/text-to-speech-faq#1TC=windows%E2%80%937">Windows</a> operating systems. </p>
