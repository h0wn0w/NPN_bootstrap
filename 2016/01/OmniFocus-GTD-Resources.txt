It's no secret, [we think GTD can be used as an effective executive functioning intervention](http://neuropsychnow.com/2014/07/neuroGTD). [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) or [Doit.im](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.doit.pro.v4) are, respectively, apps for iPhone and Android that can be used to implement [GTD](http://gettingthingsdone.com). For those of you who can't get enough of GTD or for peeps who want a good set of resources, we recommend the following:

- In 2013, The OmniGroup held a symposium of sorts and had several internet types talk about how they use OmniFocus and GTD. The collection of videos can be found [here](https://www.omnigroup.com/video/omnifocus/#the-omnifocus-setup-2013).
- David Sparks is a business attorney, and a geek, and a podcaster, and a blogger, and an author. His website [MacSparky](http://macsparky.com) is an excellent productivity resource. He has created an OmniFocus Video Field Guide that can be found [up in here](http://macsparky.com/omnifocus).
