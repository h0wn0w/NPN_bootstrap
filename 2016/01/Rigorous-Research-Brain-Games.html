<blockquote>
<p>The company notes that the FTC did not challenge claims that Lumosity improves cognition. And Lumos Labs says it won&#8217;t stop what it calls &#8220;rigorous research&#8221; exploring the link between brain training and staving off cognitive decline. </p>

<p>And</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Still, skepticism abounds among scientists. The scientific community wants to see research that is published in peer-reviewed journals, says Thomas Redick, a cognitive psychology researcher at Purdue University. He adds that studies should employ control groups and the findings should be replicated by outside scientists. The results should also be based on testing participants before and after the training, rather than relying simply on self-reporting by participants, he says.</p>
