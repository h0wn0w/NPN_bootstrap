[A recent study](http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nn.4205.html), conducted at the Imperial College of London, has linked specific clusters of genes to human intelligence. This discovery raises the possibility that, one day, gene therapy could potentially target neurodevelopmental disorders and improve general cognitive functioning.

This is a complicated study, but [here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/12061787/Intelligence-genes-discovered-by-scientists.html) is a good article for more details.
