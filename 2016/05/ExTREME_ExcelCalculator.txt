[Here][calc] is a calculator that converts the following to percentiles: 

- T (M=50, SD=10)
- z (M=0, SD=1)
- SS (M=100, SD=15)
- ss (M=10, SD=3)

This simple, but [EXTREME][extreme] Excel calculator is meant to replace the lengthy [traditional look-up table](https://www.google.com/search?q=conversion+table+percentile&safe=off&client=safari&sa=X&rls=en&biw=1211&bih=916&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&ved=0ahUKEwjJkq_Ord7KAhUEHx4KHVWgBB4QsAQILg). An added benefit is that this spreadsheet allows the user to type or paste several raw scores at once and convert them into percentiles for eventual transfer or copying to a report. I have [this spread sheet][calc] either open on my desktop or in dual view on an iPad Pro while creating tables for a report.
