As neuropsychologists, there are "tidbits" of knowledge that we convey to patients on a daily basis. Because some of this information might actually be helpful, we want to make it available on the interwebs. Thus, the purpose of these "Clinical Concepts" articles is to disseminate this potentially useful information to non-neuropsychologists who may have questions about their own cognitive functions and what can be done when they are struggling.[^fn1]     

[^fn1]: Disclaimer: If you or someone you know is having significant cognitive problems, it is always advisable to consult with a neuropsychologist or medical doctor to determine if a referral for an evaluation is necessary.
