<p>Apple&#8217;s newest desktop operating system, known as &#8220;<a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/">Mountain Lion</a>,&#8221; debut in late July 2012. Among dozens of new features was the <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/">integration of dictation</a>. This feature had come to iPhones a little over a year earlier, and was now available to desktop and laptops everywhere. We were ecstatic to hear about this at Neuropsych Now, since it meant that we could start dictating reports while at work, straight into a final document. </p>

<p>This new technology does come with a few caveats, though, that clinicians need to be aware of. First, in order to use dictation you must have an Internet connection. This is because, unlike <a href="http://www.nuance.com/">Dragon Naturally Speaking</a>, which transcribes your speech on-the-fly, your Mac&#8217;s dictation occurs in a server center somewhere else in the wide world. In short, your voice is sent to one of Apple&#8217;s data centers for translation and is then sent back to your local machine. While this was necessary on the iPhone due to processor and storage limits (and raised some of the same concerns for both <a href="http://techie-buzz.com/apple-2/siri-privacy-concerns.html">Apple&#8217;s built-in Siri</a> and Nuance&#8217;s <a href="http://www.imore.com/nuance-responds-dragon-dictation-iphone-privacy-concerns">Dragon Dictate for iPhone</a>), the same does not hold true for the much more powerful desktop operating systems (case in point: Dragon). </p>

<p>This brings us to the second point: whatever Apple&#8217;s reasons are for pulling such data to the cloud, the implication is clear: if you&#8217;re dictating reports using this service, everything you say is being sent, unencrypted, across the Internet and back. This is a clear violation of <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/srsummary.html">HIPAA policy for handling PHI</a>. The best way around this is to either omit, or use a substitution for, your patient&#8217;s name. </p>

<p>At Neuropsych Now, we like to use names of famous individuals to make it easy and to reduce or remove the risk of PHI being compromised. So, &#8220;John Doe&#8221; becomes &#8220;Erol Flynn&#8221;, or whomever you prefer. Since you&#8217;re handling more than one case at a time, you can code each report with a simple number that, just like in a research database, will match up with the person&#8217;s real name and other PHI. Once you&#8217;re finished dictating the report, simply do a find and replace for Erol Flynn with the correct information. This workaround is intuitive, simple, and totally compliant with HIPAA. </p>

<p>In a later post, we&#8217;ll talk more about using your iPhone (and/or newer models of iPad) to dictate while on the go or in the office.</p>
