The [previous post](http://neuropsychnow.com/2012/12/HIPAA_Cloud) covered some fundamental issues with respect to the storage, maintenance and transfer of PHI. This post will go over what it means to have a server/computer/system that is HIPAA compliant. For reference, here is the link to the [HIPAA Health Information Technology page](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/special/healthit/index.html). 

## The Mission

The following statement was copied From the [HIPAA Nationwide Privacy and Security Framework for Electronic Exchange of Individually Identifiable Health Information page](http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt?open=512&objID=1173&parentname=CommunityPage&parentid=3&mode=2&in_hi_userid=10741&cached=true):

>"The goal of this effort is to establish a policy framework for electronic health information exchange that can help guide the Nationâ€™s adoption of health information technologies and help improve the availability of health information and health care quality. The principles have been designed to establish the roles of individuals and the responsibilities of those who hold and exchange electronic individually identifiable health information through a network."

## The Security Standards

The HIPAA security standards are divided up into four sections (links below will redirect to a downloadable PDF). Even if you're familiar with the guidelines, it may help to get reacquainted with the [overarching principles of covered entities](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/securityrule/security101.pdf) before going over those.
