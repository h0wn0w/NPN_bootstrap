An estimated 5.4 million Americans have Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type (AD). This includes approximately 200,000 individuals with early onset AD (under the age of 65; Alzheimer's Association, 2012). Alzheimer's is a neuropathological "disease" that is well in motion by the time memory problems surface and a patient is referred to a memory clinic. Some evidence suggests Alzheimer's pathology begins in different areas of the brain stem, but *symptoms* (like memory dysfunction) appear later in the course of the disease when cortical regions become dysfunctional. One main goal of current research is to  detect the presence of the disease, prior to symptom onset, so appropriate interventions can be developed.

To accomplish research goals that seek to identify prodromal phases of Alzheimer's, the clinical criteria for AD are being honed. McKhann, et al. (2011) propos a sweeping restructuring of the original criteria (codified in 1984) that incorporates more modern and well-accepted research that shifted our understanding of AD as a disease and syndrome. 



## Memory Impairment as a Defining Characteristic?

Although memory impairment is and has been the primary defining feature of AD, it is unlikely that it will continue to be a necessary (it has never been sufficient) condition when diagnosing AD (Mckhann, 2011). Indeed, on the table is a *non-amnestic* type, which may end up including what we now refer to as Posterior Cortical Atrophy, or PCA. The notion of PCA as a clinical presentation of Alzheimer's Disease has received increased support from research (e.g., Alves, Soares, Sampaio, & Gonçalves (2013)). Other non-amnestic clinical syndromes of Alzheimer's might include primary impairments in language (e.g., logopenic aphasia, which has been associated with amyloid pathology), or executive functioning. 

## Genetic Biomarkers and Neurocognitive Change ##


Advances since the 1984 Alzheimer's criteria include the discovery of potential AD biomarkers. Specifically, genetic mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 and biomarkers including amyloid-beta protein and tau/p-tau are measured, when possible, to assist with diagnosis. The presence of these biomarkers has demonstrated good reliability and validity in establishing a positive diagnosis of AD.

Neuropsychological testing has also advanced in its ability to detect pre-clinical signs of Alzheimer's. As noted by Bondi, Jak, Delano-Wood, Jacobson, Delis, and Salmon (2008) in their review of literature covering neuropsychological testing for AD:

>"The neuropsychological studies indicated that prodromal AD is characterized by subtle deficits in a broad range of neuropsychological domains, particularly in learning and memory, executive functioning, processing speed, attention, and semantic knowledge." 

In particular, and poignantly: 

>"Thus, there exist several potential markers of a prodromal period of AD, in which specific cognitive and biomarker changes precede the clinical manifestations."

## Past Is Prologue ##

Definitions of pathology are constantly under scrutiny; they are never truly stable {==what does "they are never truly stable mean?"==}{>>@smt - 2013-08-27 11:03:13<<}. It {==should come as no surprise that the current conceptualization of Alzheimer's *will not* be the Alzheimer's we know in 10, or even fewer, years. Alzheimer's Disease, from any perspective, is far removed from being well understood. This is especially true when considering that individuals over age 80 comprise the fastest-growing age demographic in the United States (Bondi et al., 2008) and are much more likely to receive a diagnosis of Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type compared to any (relatively) younger group. This cohort is especially fallow ground for research, and will play a large part in our re-learning of this complex and catastrophic pathology. ==}{>>I'm not sure i am following what you are saying in this paragraph....@smt - 2013-08-27 11:05:26<<}
