<h2 id="theintake">The Intake</h2>

<p>I like to try and dictate everything from an intake interview immediately after it&#8217;s over. This is basically just what Dr. Testa described in the <a href="../07/gettingreportsdone.html">&#8220;Getting Reports Done&#8221; article</a>. Since the iPhone has dictation capability built in, I can use it to dictate straight to a blank document. Of course, when I dictate, I substitute any Protected Health Information with pseudonyms or placeholders. Personally, I use the names of famous people in place of the actual name, and substitute any personal information such as place of birth with placeholders like &#8220;City, State&#8221;. Once I&#8217;m finished dictating, I save the file into a directory that is synchronized to my desk top computer with <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/" title="Dropbox">Dropbox</a>, and it&#8217;s now ready to be inserted into a separate file that is used specifically for that patient&#8217;s report. </p>

<p>A couple of quick notes about dictation of this type: first, it is not pretty, nor is it intended to be. The important thing is that I am dictating from my notes immediately after finishing the intake. This way, the information is absolutely fresh in my mind. The other thing I&#8217;ve found is that things go much more smoothly if I dictate as kind of a stream of thought. So, although I try to follow through in my dictation in the same order that information will appear in the report, I don&#8217;t stick to this hard and fast. My dictations are full of colloquialisms, misspoken words, and redundancies. This was really hard for me to do at first, since I wanted to dictate something that was going to nearly approximate a finished product; however, I found that if I just dictated in a more conversational manner that the information came out much more like a narrative, which is what I wanted.</p>

<h2 id="reportsetup">Report Setup</h2>

<p>So, now that I have dictated all the information from the intake, whether it is in a pretty format or not, I need to do something with it. So, the next step is to get it into its own document. I can&#8217;t just leave it in that synchronized file, since replacing my placeholders with PHI would be a violation of the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/privacyrule/index.html" title="The Privacy Rule - U.S. Department of Health and Human Services">HIPAA Privacy Rule</a> This is where I use my other favorite report writing tool: <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html" title="TextExpander: Mac Typing Shortcut Utility Saves You Time - Smile">TextExpander</a>. </p>

<p>For many years I used a Microsoft word document template to start each report. This is still a great way to work, but I replaced it with TextExpander and a blank plain text file, which is something that works much better for me. For a quick example of what text expander can do, take a quick look at our previous article about using it to create a mental status section. Briefly, text expander allows one to type a small set of characters, which are then &#8220;expanded&#8221; into a word, phrase, or even an entire report template. I started by taking words I often used and created snippets with them. Words like &#8220;neuropsychological,&#8221; &#8220;neurocognitive,&#8221; and &#8220;hypertension&#8221; were good first targets. I quickly moved on to longer phrases, like &#8220;Durable Power of Attorney&#8221; and &#8220;The patient&#8217;s medical history is positive for&#8221;. Here are the abbreviations for each of these, in order: </p>

<p><code>
<code>,nl</code> = neuropsychological<br>
<code>,ng</code> = neurocognitive<br>
<code>htn</code> = hypertension<br>
<code>,dpa</code> = Durable Power of Attorney<br>
<code>mdhx</code> = The patient&#8217;s medical history is positive for<br>
</code></p>

<p>The next step to all of this is creating a kind of dynamic system for generating the structure (and <em>some</em> of the content) for an entire neuropsychological report. For an outpatient report, I open a blank document (no template files required!) and I use Text Expander to start out each one of my reports by typing the following: </p>

<p><code>,skelout</code></p>
