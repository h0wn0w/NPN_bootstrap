<p>Neuropsychologists employ a variety of methods to determine the validity of test scores obtained during an evaluation. Validity testing is probably the most discussed and controversial topic in the field of neuropsychology. Because validity testing is extremely useful in situations when symptom exaggeration and malingering are likely, it is very important that the details of our methods are not publicized. Thus, there are certain aspects of validity testing that we will never address on this website. At the same time, we feel it is important for neuropsychologists and neuropsychology trainees to stay informed about new resources or controversies related to validity testing (e.g., <a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0422510006">social security and malingering</a>). Ultimately, we <em>will</em> publish content related to this important topic, but will always aspire to do so in an appropriate, judicious manner.</p>

<p>Thanks again for reading, and please keep coming back!</p>
