<p>We&#8217;re adding something new to Neuropsych Now: some (hopefully) decent science reporting from around the Web. The reason for this is simple &#8211; it makes it easier for us to get out more content on a regular basis. </p>

<p>Writing <a href="http://neuropsychnow.com/articles.html">original articles</a>, even shorter ones, producing our recent smattering of <a href="http://neuropsychnow.com/tags/Screencast">screencasts</a> and intermittently maintaining and updating the site is a lot of work. Not that we&#8217;re complaining. Being able to work on something that we think is useful and adds meaning to our field is tremendously rewarding. We also just renewed the Neuropsych Now domain name, so we at least <em>look</em> like we&#8217;re committed to this, right? </p>

<p>As with everything, we hope you find this new, small &#8220;expansion&#8221; of Neuropsych Now useful and/or entertaining. If not, please let [Steve Ballmer] know(mailto:steveb@microsoft.com). He handles all of our compalints and issues.</p>

<p>The Guardian reports on a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/nov/25/could-a-brain-scan-diagnose-you-as-a-psychopath">neuroscientist that believes he can diagnose pathology from fMRI</a>. The article&#8217;s author, <a href="http://psych.cf.ac.uk/contactsandpeople/researchfellows/chambers.php">Chris Chambers</a>, does a good job at pointing out the fundamental flaws in this notion, and in a way that seems fit for consumption by non-science-y mortals. There&#8217;s a great statement about confirmation bias at the end, too: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;neuroscientists like Fallon would do well to heed Richard Feynman&#8217;s famous warning: &#8216;The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true. I know because I fool myself sometimes. Constantly.</p>
