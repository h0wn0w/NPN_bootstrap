The [previous post](http://neuropsychnow.com/2013/09/HIPAA_Cloud_1.html) covered  fundamental issues about storing, maintaining, and transferring PHI. This post simply provides you with resources specific to the Privacy & Security rules. 

## Resources to Read  ##

For the next 3 days, spend 30 minutes each day to read these:

* Surprisingly readable, this is a *comprehensive* [Guide to Privacy and Security of Health Information](http://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/privacy/privacy-and-security-guide.pdf) from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. 
* For an excellent list of resources, head over to their main [resources page](http://www.healthit.gov/providers-professionals/ehr-privacy-security/resources).
* For reference, here is the link to the [HIPAA Health Information Technology page](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/special/healthit/index.html). 

## Resources to Use ##

We all provide patients with information about privacy practices (right?). HITECH, however, changes the how, what, when, why and where of exchanging ePHI. As a result, private practitioners and hospitals alike *must* update their Notice of Privacy Practices. Trying to determine what specific information should go into such a notice from reading the HITECH documentation could be challenging.[^1] 

The American Psychological Association has put together a package of model privacy notices that are compliant with the upcoming changes. Importantly, there is an associated cost ranging from $225 to $600. Fortunately, there are some free resources that may get you where you need to go, including [this model Notice of Privacy Practices](http://d.pr/f/RGvo), made available by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights.[^2] It's not obvious, but *you can download it and customize this form with your practice's information*. Just use a a PDF reader or an internet browser.

Stay tuned for more!
