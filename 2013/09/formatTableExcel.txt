One very effective way to turn reports around faster is to use an Excel-based template for scoring or formatting. Though computerized scoring programs (e.g., WAIS-IV Scoring Assistant, Q-Local) make scoring a protocol easy, there may be an additional need to format the output.

This screencast demonstrates how to use Excel to "grab" data scored by a scoring program (in this case the Calibrated Neuropsychological Normative System-Software Portfolio; [CNNS-SP](http://www4.parinc.com/Products/Product.aspx?ProductID=CNNS)) and to generate a figure that can be used during a team discussion or pasted into the body of the final report itself. The particular template demonstrated in the screencast is used in a dementia clinic and allows for great efficiency in a fast moving clinical situation. 

Anyway, enjoy the magic show!
