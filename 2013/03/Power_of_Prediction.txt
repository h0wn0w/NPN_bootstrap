Knowing how well a test can detect the presence (sensitivity) or absence (specificity) of a condition is only part of the diagnostic classification battle. Suppose an individual scores in the "positive" range on a measure that can detect malingering 30% of the time (sensitivity) and correctly rule out malingering 90% of the time (specificity). How confident are you that this person's score is a true positive and not a false positive? This is where *negative and positive predictive power* (NPP and PPP) are useful (see Figure for basic depiction).

NPP and PPP estimate the probability that a negative or positive test result is accurate. In the sample malingering case, 10% of non-malingerers and 30% of malingerers score in the positive range. PPP is used to determine the probability that a positive test score is accurate. PPP is calculated by dividing the number of true positive test results by the total number of positive test results. Thus, if the sensitivity and specificity values were based on a sample of 100 malingerers and 100 non-malingerers, there are 30 true positives and 10 false positives. The PPP is 30/(30+10)=75%. So, 75 times out of a 100 a positive test result is accurate.[^1] In the table below, you can see how PPP and NPP can change as sensitivity increases and specificity is held constant.

|Sensitivity	|Specificity	|PPP	|NPP	|  
|:----------:	|:---------:	|:---:	|:---:	|  
|30	|90	|75	|56	|  
|35	|90	|77	|58	|  
|40	|90	|80	|60	|  
|45	|90	|82	|62	|  
[Table. Changes in PPP and NPP as a function of increased sensitivity.]

It is important to remember that diagnostic classification is not just about sensitivity and specificity. NPP and PPP help you make sense of a score in the context of sensitivity and specificity. Suppose you administer a test with low sensitivity and high specificity. The PPP and NPP will be very elevated and clinically informative.





[^1]: The negative predictive value suggests that slightly more than half of the negative test results are accurate (90/(90+70)=56%).
