<p>As much of a banal time-suck as YouTube can be, we <em>had</em> to link to this video. The speaker, Clay Christensen, <a href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yoW5x71vbJc">delivers his perspective</a> on the structural problems of healthcare-at-large. His presentation is intriguing enough that, despite the 63-minute run time, it was easy to watch from beginning to end. </p>

<p>Perhaps even more interesting, though, is his preamble to the talk. During the opening minutes, it should be clear that he is having some expressive speech difficulties. He addresses this in the opening minutes by telling the audience about a stroke that he sustained the year prior, the sequelae, and his own, self-initiated cognitive rehabilitation. The insight he had into his impairment and how he went about self-rehabilitation is fascinating. </p>

<p>The entire video is absolutely worth the time spent to watch it; if you do nothing else, though, watch the opening minutes to hear his story. For those of you who <em>truly</em> have no time to spare, the stroke narrative begins at approximately 2&#8217;30". </p>
