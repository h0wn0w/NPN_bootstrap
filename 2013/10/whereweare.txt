You've probably been wondering to yourself lately: "where did those 'Now Neuropsychology', or whatever they're called, guys run off to? Have I been abandoned?" Maybe you have even been losing sleep over it. 

Please don't worry. Everything is fine, and we're still loaded up with all kinds of ideas and content. Some of it's coming very soon. Mainly, it's coming as soon as other, objectively more pressing responsibilities are managed. You understand, right? Also, we have a nice little "gift" to go along with an upcoming article and screencast that some of you will probably like. 

So, Stay tuned.
