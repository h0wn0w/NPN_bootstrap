<p>You&#8217;ve probably been wondering to yourself lately: &#8220;where did those &#8216;Now Neuropsychology&#8217;, or whatever they&#8217;re called, guys run off to? Have I been abandoned?&#8221; Maybe you have even been losing sleep over it. </p>

<p>Please don&#8217;t worry. Everything is fine, and we&#8217;re still loaded up with all kinds of ideas and content. Some of it&#8217;s coming very soon. Mainly, it&#8217;s coming as soon as other, objectively more pressing responsibilities are managed. You understand, right? Also, we have a nice little &#8220;gift&#8221; to go along with an upcoming article and screencast that some of you will probably like. </p>

<p>So, Stay tuned.</p>
