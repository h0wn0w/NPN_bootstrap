Thank you for taking time to check out Neuropsych Now, a site that was created by W. Howard Buddin Jr., Ph.D. and S. Marc Testa, Ph.D. with the hope that it would flourish and mature into a deep, wide repository of neuropsychological knowledge and resources. 

This, as you know by now, is our "Articles" section. Here, we will do our level best to write articles for neuropsychologists, the kind of which you won't likely find anywhere else. Some of our articles will cover clinical topics, others will involve discussions more focused on neuropsychologists' work habits and ways and means to enhance productivity (e.g., how to write reports in a more efficient manner). 

This is article zero: it is our "inaugural" article, if you will. It's just us saying "hi."

Truth be told, though, we've been hard at work for about six months putting this all together. We have projects that we'll be rolling out over the next few months that we can't wait for you to see (and hear!!). In between, we will make sure to deliver new articles on a regular basis (about one new article per week to start). 

If our plans and aspirations go *even close* to the way we'd like them to, this thing could get big. 

This is very exciting to us. We hope you're at least a little intrigued, if not excited, too. Please take time to explore the rest of the site, and don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:admin@neuropsychnow.com) with any thoughts or ideas. 

Thank you again, and we hope that you enjoy Neuropsych Now!
