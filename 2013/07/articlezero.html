<p>Welcome, and thank you for taking time to check out Neuropsych Now! </p>

<p>This is &#8220;article zero&#8221; - our &#8220;inaugural&#8221; article, if you will, wherein we&#8217;d like to take just a moment to introduce you to the site.</p>

<p>We conceived and built this site with the hope that it will flourish and mature into a go-to repository of neuropsychological knowledge and resources. </p>

<p>Here, in our &#8220;Articles&#8221; section, is where we publish articles for neuropsychologists, the kind of which you won&#8217;t likely find anywhere else. Some will cover clinical topics, others will involve discussions that are more focused on neuropsychologists&#8217; work habits, including ways and means to enhance productivity (e.g., how to write reports in a more efficient manner). </p>

<p>Truth be told, though, we&#8217;ve been hard at work for about six months putting this all together. We have projects that we&#8217;ll be rolling out over the next few months that we can&#8217;t wait for you to see (and hear!!). In between, we will make sure to deliver new articles on a regular basis (about one new article per week to start). </p>

<p>If our plans and aspirations go <em>even close</em> to the way we&#8217;d like them to, this thing could get big. </p>

<p>This is very exciting to us. We hope you&#8217;re at least a little intrigued, if not excited, too. Please take time to explore the rest of the site, and don&#8217;t hesitate to <a href="mailto:admin@neuropsychnow.com">contact us</a> with any thoughts or ideas. </p>

<p>Thank you again, and we hope that you enjoy Neuropsych Now!</p>
