<!-- # Excel Spreadsheet Building Blocks II: NORM**<u>S</u>**DIST and NORMDIST # -->
In this 2nd of 3 Excel guides, we review two functions that are extremely useful if you want to convert a standard score (like a z score or T-score) to a percentile. In [Part 1] of the series, we demonstrated how a regression-based normative (RBN) equation can be embedded in a spreadsheet to calculate an estimated IQ score. We stopped short, however, and did not convert the IQ score to a percentile. To carryout such a conversion, the Excel function NORMDIST is used. There is also NORM**<u>S</u>**DIST, which would be useful only for converting a z score to a percentile. Both functions, NORM**<u>S</u>**DIST and NORMDIST, are reviewed below. If you would like to practice along at home, [the spreadsheet can be found here.]

## NORM**<u>S</u>**DIST and NORMDIST ##
NORMSDIST or NORMDIST are extremely useful because they obviate the need to lookup tabled percentiles. Lets start with NORM-**S**-DIST, since it is more straightforward than NORMDIST.

### NORM**<U>S</U>**DIST ###

NORMSDIST is used to covert a z score to a percentile. The function is:

        =NORMSDIST(z)*100

In the sample spreadsheet, NORMSDIST is used in cells E15, E16, and E17 to convert a z score calculated in cells I15, I16 and I17 (more on how those z score were computed in a future post about the LOOKUP function).

Simply type this formula in the cell you want the percentile to appear (here, E15 ) and replace the "z" with the actual z score value or the cell reference that contains the z score (here, I15). The resultant value, after multiplying by 100, will be a percentile (in this case 35th %ile).

    =NORMSDIST(I15)*100

To see if you understand, try entering z scores of -1, 0, and +1 and see if each result is 16, 50, and 84.  

####Embedded NORMSDIST computations
In the spreadsheet, a z score was computed in a separate cell (I15). However, this is an unnecessary step because the z score can be computed within NORMSDIST. The formula to convert an actual test score to a z score could have referenced the examinee's scores and the normative mean and standard deviations directly like this:

        =NORMSDIST((C15-J15)/K15)*100

Which wound also return a value of 35.

###"NORMDIST"

NORMDIST is used to convert a standardized score, like a T-score (M=50, SD=10) or scaled score (M=10, SD=3), to a percentile. The formula is:

        =NORMDIST(x, mean, standard deviation, cumulative)*100

where:

* "x" = the number or cell you want to convert (e.g. a T-score of 40)
* Mean = the mean of the scale you are converting from (in this case 50)
* SD = the standard deviation of the scale you are converting from (in this case 10).
* Cumulative will typically remain in the default mode of 1 or true.
* The function should be multiplied by 100, otherwise the result will be a decimal. 

Thus, the formula:

    =NORMDIST(40, 50, 10, TRUE)*100

Will result in the value "16".

In the sample spreadsheet (FIgure 3), cell C12 contains an IQ value of 123 and we would like to convert this to a percentile in cell E12. The formula is:

    =NORMDIST(C12, 100, 15, 1)*100

The equation above converts cell C12 to a percentile (94) based on a scale that has a mean of 100 and an SD of 15.

The next post in the Excel Table series will show you how to use the LOOKUP functions and explain a little about formatting for MultiMarkdown output.
