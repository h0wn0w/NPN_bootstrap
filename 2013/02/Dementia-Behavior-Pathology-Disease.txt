Warning! You are entering a soapbox zone...

Dementia is a term that is misused at an alarming rate. Overtime, the term dementia has evolved to reflect **inaccurately** a disease entity that is permanent, progressive, and nearly interchangeable with Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal degeneration, etc.

The concept and term dementia refers to:

>a state of acquired intellectual deterioration which significantly interferes with an individualâ€™s personal, social and occupational roles.

Importantly, someone with Alzheimer's disease (i.e. a neuropathological entity) may or may not be classified as having "dementia". 

>The presence of dementia would then denote a stage of the disorder at which symptoms have become so severe that activities of daily living are significantly compromised.
