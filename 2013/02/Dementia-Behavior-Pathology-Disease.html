<p>Warning! You are entering a soapbox zone&#8230;</p>

<p>Dementia is a term that is misused at an alarming rate. Overtime, the term dementia has evolved to reflect <strong>inaccurately</strong> a disease entity that is permanent, progressive, and nearly interchangeable with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, frontotemporal degeneration, etc.</p>

<p>The concept and term dementia refers to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a state of acquired intellectual deterioration which significantly interferes with an individual&#8217;s personal, social and occupational roles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Importantly, someone with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (i.e. a neuropathological entity) may or may not be classified as having &#8220;dementia&#8221;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The presence of dementia would then denote a stage of the disorder at which symptoms have become so severe that activities of daily living are significantly compromised.</p>
