<p>The holiday times offer a good respite from day-to-day neuropsychology practice. It is also a good opportunity to catch up on themes and topics that are important to your own clinical practice. As healthcare practices are emphasizing quality and evidence-based practice, it seems important for neuropsychologists to understand how we can contribute. There are a number of articles that highlight this important point and are worth reviewing. To understand how all of this may be helpful to clinical practice, read through this <a href="https://karen-postal.squarespace.com/thought-experiment">&#8220;Thought Experiment&#8221;</a> over at <a href="http://neuropsychologytoolkit.com">Neuropsychology Tool Kit</a>.</p>

<p>The first is an <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18821179">article</a> by Gordon Chelune that provides a very good overview of what an evidence-based neuropsychology report could entail and how one could begin to track clinical outcomes in a manner that can demonstrate the value of neuropsychological services. (<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=16059754319465616780&amp;amp;as_sdt=20000005&amp;amp;sciodt=0,21&amp;amp;hl=en">Here</a> is a Google Scholar link that lists sources referencing this paper.</p>

<p>Two more recent articles from David Loring and Stephen Bowden are available in the latest article section of The Clinical Neuropsychologist. The <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13854046.2013.776636#.UrGtvJFdeao">first</a> reviews a method to implement a more evidenced-based approach and clinical practice that helps the clinician evaluate new research findings, improve research quality, and incorporate a way to evaluate the clinical impact of studies into professional development activities. The <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13854046.2012.762552">second</a> is an overview of the <a href="http://www.strobe-statement.org/" title="STROBE Statement: Home">STROBE</a> (STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology) criteria and their relevance to the data reporting in neuropsychology research.</p>

<p>As Neuropsychology advocacy is becoming more and more important, we here at NeuroPsych Now will certainly be highlighting studies that demonstrate how neuropsychological assessments can decrease healthcare costs. </p>
