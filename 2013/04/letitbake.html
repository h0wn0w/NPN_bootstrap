<p>You&#8217;re busy if all is going well in your day-to-day work as a neuropsychologist. Because of this, we spend a fair amount of time at Neuropsych Now figuring out ways to help you trim the amount of time you spend on the (admittedly necessary) tedium of practice. In this article, though, we&#8217;re going to advocate something very different: take your time writing reports. </p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve read any of our other articles on report writing, you could be forgiven for thinking that we are all about burning through each and every report as quickly as possible. Allow us to mitigate some of that sentiment with this article. </p>

<h2 id="step1">Step 1</h2>

<p>Get the report written. Sounds stupid to say it, but sometimes a little meta-awareness and self-therapy can be useful. When we&#8217;re dictating or writing reports, we focus as much as possible on just <em>getting the content out</em>. Getting your clinical story from brain to paper oftentimes represents the greatest challenge. Think about it - you already know the history, test results, and probably the diagnosis before you begin writing the report. So why is the process sometimes so difficult? </p>

<p>The answer is far from simple, but it&#8217;s probably fair to say that we are our own worst enemies. We all have a tendency to over-think things, and it&#8217;s easy to do when you&#8217;re trying to parse a patient&#8217;s narrative into a concise, sensible report. If you have the wherewithal to realize when you&#8217;re stuck or frustrated on a report, then capitalize on that. Stop for a moment to reflect on the state of things - are you stuck because you&#8217;re working your brain too hard over the structure of a sentence? Or is it something else, like wrangling a thesaurus for a pithy diagnostic phrase?<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> The quick fix to problems such as these is <em>just write.</em> Save the editing and fine-tuning for later and just get the story out. Any professional writer will tell you something similar: they&#8217;d never be able to finish a book if they sweated each detail along the way.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> </p>

<h2 id="step2">Step 2</h2>

<p>The idea is very simply stated in the title: &#8220;let it bake.&#8221; The idea here is to finish each report and let it sit, if possible, for a day or so.<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a> Go back and take a look. Edit to your heart&#8217;s content, slash and burn, whatever you want. The difference between doing it after you&#8217;ve let it sit for a day versus trying to do it all in one sitting is that you&#8217;ve given yourself time to <em>not</em> think about the report. After a day, you are effectively approaching it with a new set of eyes. You&#8217;ll see elements such as redundancies, poorly worded phrases, and more, all of which you might have missed the day before. This phenomenon should be very familiar to us all, and is especially true with longer documents like manuscripts. </p>

<p>Having a finely-tuned sense of self-awareness like this takes practice. The payoff, though, is avoidance of diminishing returns that you get from staring at the same document for just a little bit too long. </p>
