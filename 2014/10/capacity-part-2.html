<p>A few weeks ago, we wrote up a brief introduction on the <a href="http://neuropsychnow.com/2014/07/capacityPrimer.html">fundamentals of capacity</a>. For this article, we&#8217;ll get a little more granular and &#8220;real world.&#8221; </p>

<h2 id="isanassessmentwarranted">Is an Assessment Warranted?</h2>

<p>Appropriately enough, the first topic to address is whether or not to even begin considering an evaluation of someone&#8217;s capacity. Indeed, this is not always clear. The referral may make no mention of concerns in this area; your patient might present as totally pleasant and conversational; the latter of these might mask otherwise serious problems. Fortunately, there are often environmental or situational factors that can indicate the need for further investigation. </p>

<h3 id="lookforcluesinthemedicalrecord">Look for clues in the medical record</h3>

<p>Progress notes, history and physical, etc. can provide some insight regarding the patient&#8217;s &#8220;track record&#8221; with adherence to past recommendations and prescribed treatments. If there is some indication of low adherence, the next course might be to investigate your patient&#8217;s <em>understanding of their healthcare needs.</em> </p>

<p>It is generally unreasonable or unrealistic to expect your patient to be able to name each of their medications and respective dosages; it is closer to the mark to ask them what kinds of things they need medicine for. There are many ways to craft such a question, and how you do so will be at least partly dependent on your patient&#8217;s age, education, and cultural identification. </p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Are they refusing medication or treatment because they have carefully weighed the risk/reward outcomes, or because they believe that the attending works for a government mind-control agency?</p>

<h2 id="whatdotheyknow">What Do They Know?</h2>

<p>Assessment of an individual&#8217;s broad cognitive abilities should be considered when rendering a decision about capacity. The rationale is that their current cognitive functioning might speak to their ability to make sense of all available information regarding treatment options. <em>Caveat emptor:</em> while intellectual disability <em>can</em> have an impact on one&#8217;s ability to successfully understand, integrate, and communicate the information needed to make a reasoned choice, impaired cognitive status alone is <em>neither sufficient nor is it a necessary component</em> for determining (lack of) capacity. </p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> A patient refuses chemotherapy and radiation for treatment of her recently diagnosed cancer. She refuses treatment based on the recollection of her mother&#8217;s experience with the same treatment. She recounts that &#8220;it was horrible and it didn&#8217;t work.&#8221; This is verified by the patient&#8217;s adult children, who were witnesses to their grandmother&#8217;s unsuccessful cancer therapy.</p>

<h2 id="whatdotheysay">What Do They Say?</h2>

<p>The ability to communicate a choice is another fundamental aspect of the assessment process. What are your patient&#8217;s verbal expressive abilities like? Do they use regional colloquialisms that might confound <em>your</em> understanding? Are they unable to verbally express a choice, and if so is the inability reflective of (A) a physical limitation or (B) a cognitive limitation? Ultimately, you must consider that a patient may have the <em>cognitive</em> wherewithal to effectively communicate a choice, but is limited in their ability to <em>actually</em> do so.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> The patient simply has laryngitis versus expressive limitations due to e.g., profound intellectual disability. </p>

<h2 id="theaidtocapacityevaluationace">The Aid to Capacity Evaluation (ACE)</h2>

<p>One tool to help with the evaluation of capacity for decision-making is the Aid to Capacity Evaluation (ACE). The ACE is a brief, semi-structured interview/assessment that covers the major areas from this article and more. You can download the ACE from our <a href="http://neuropsychnow.com/downloads.html">assessment resources page</a>. </p>
