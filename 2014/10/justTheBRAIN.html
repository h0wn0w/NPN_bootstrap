<p>The BRAIN initiative is a federally funded project administered by the National Institutes of Health as a multi-year, multi-site endeavor. The goals of this project are to: </p>

<ol>
<li>Identify and provide experimental access to the different brain cell types to determine their roles in health and disease.</li>
<li>Generate circuit diagrams that vary in resolution from synapses to the whole brain.</li>
<li>Produce a dynamic picture of the functioning brain by developing and applying improved methods for large-scale monitoring of neural activity.</li>
<li>Link brain activity to behavior with precise interventional tools that change neural circuit dynamics.</li>
<li>Produce conceptual foundations for understanding the biological basis of mental processes through development of new theoretical and data analysis tools.</li>
<li>Develop innovative technologies to understand the human brain and treat its disorders; create and support integrated human brain research networks.</li>
<li>Integrate new technological and conceptual approaches produced in Goals #1&#8211;6 to discover how dynamic patterns of neural activity are transformed into cognition, emotion, perception, and action in health and disease.</li>
</ol>

<p>The most current information is <a href="http://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/2025/index.htmP">available in the form of a report</a> prepared by the BRAIN working group. This is a fascinating project, and even if they don&#8217;t hit all of their goals, it&#8217;s a step in the right direction. </p>
