## Then ##


The year was 1984. Everyone sent reports, invoices, and just about any other paper document by fax. These were heady times.

## Now ##

1984 has been over for a while - for *at least* 10 years, I'd say.

Now, we have The Internet. High capacity scanners. Encrypted, online document storage systems.[^1] Are we maximizing their potential in day-to-day practice? Anectodally, it doesn't seem to be the case. So, why not?

## "It's Too (Insert Adjective Describing Presumed Defeat)" ##

1. "I'm too busy." 
	* We understand. So are we. Let's call this a normative condition and remove it from the equation.
2. "It's going to take too much time to set up, and I operate primarily on proximal, versus distal, rewards."
	* Fair enough. If nothing else, the money you make *when you are actively billing* is hard to compete with. Spending time buying hardware, configuring software, etc., is not in itself any kind of immediate payout; however, the gain over a not-so-long term is great. You'll spend less time doing clerical work during what *could* be a clinical hour. Hence, time is effectively created. This is the colloquial principle of *addition by subtraction.*
3. "It will cost too much."
	* Here's a financial quiz: what costs more, (1) paying for filing cabinets for on-premises storage AND paying to warehouse files for off-premises storage, or (2) spending *maybe* $200/year for a pair of Hard Disk Drives on which your files can be electronically archived?
 
Many of the barriers to these technologies (such as financial cost, ease of configuration) have been reduced or eliminated altogether. Hell's bells, [Building a web site][1] ain't even hard no more. 

Neuropsychologists are generally intelligent, capable people. As a neuropsychologist (or a student of neuropsychology), one learns many important facets of how the brain functions when it is exposed to both normal and pathological circumstances. The process of learning to master various processes, applications (read: "apps"), and the devices on which they run is much, *much* easier. We promise. 


Working towards a paperless office, or approximation thereof, is not necessarily an easy task. The setup starts with the hardware, so this is as good a place as any for us to start. In this article, we're going to cover the *what* and *why* of gear. We'll discuss generic and specific components that will get you and your office/practice moving away from the ancient art of file-hunting and towards the modern world of... "wait, where did the file cabinets go?"

## The Hardware ##

We have [written](http://neuropsychnow.com/2013/07/ExcelSpreadsheetBuildingBlocks1Equations) a lot about [software](http://neuropsychnow.com/2013/07/hackWord) and [how we use it](http://neuropsychnow.com/2013/10/expandWord). Now it's time for the machines to get their turn.

### The Scanner ###

*What:* The [Fujitsu ScanSnap ix500](http://www.fujitsu.com/us/services/computing/peripherals/scanners/scansnap/scansnap-iX500.html)

![ScanSnap][]

*Why*

I did not lightly assign the definite article used above. It is *The* Fujitsu ScanSnap. I use it for, well, scanning, including *all* patient records, test protocols and response booklets. This article *is*, after all, about running a paperless office. I use *this particular* machine because it does what it does better than any other scanner I've seen.[^2] I also use it for fighting. 

The Fujitsu ScanSnap ix500 is an incredible sheetfed scanner, period. It's a best-in-class machine, and if you get/have one you know exactly what I'm talking about. The ix500 will scan up to 25 pages per minute, *full color, both sides*. It will also take the registration form that your patient's kids crumpled and scan it flawlessly. 

The ix500 will set you back anywhere from roughly $400 to $500, depending on where you get it and whether or not you buy the [Deluxe](http://www.fujitsu.com/us/services/computing/peripherals/scanners/scansnap/scansnap-iX500-deluxe-bundle.html) version or the [Evernote](#) version.[^4]

Of course, all of these files need to be archived *and* backed up. See our [article on backing up your data](http://neuropsychnow.com/2014/01/Backing_Up_Data) for more on that topic. 

### The Printer ###

*What*

A [Canon mf4550](http://www.canon-europe.com/For_Home/Product_Finder/Multifunctionals/Laser/i-SENSYS_MF4550d/ "Canon i-SENSYS MF4550d - i-SENSYS Laser Multifunction Printers ...") multi-function machine for copying and printing. 

*Why*

Apparently, my patients expect to get a full-fledged report mailed to them. So, occasionally, I need to print. And copy. I don't use it for scanning [^5] or faxing. [^6]

Why this one? I inherited it. It performs about as well as most mid-priced multi-functions I've used, though this particular model is deprecated.  

### The Non-Existent Fax ###

*What*

As stated above: none. Since a fax is very much a part of the traditional office arsenal, it seemed fitting to also talk about what I *do not* use.

"What?!?" you might exclaim, "No fax-o-matic?" 

Roger that. 

There *is* a need for faxing capabilities, though. Even if I don't send faxes, many, if not most, other providers will expect to be able to send faxes of records. So, what is the solution? 

Enter [HelloFax][2], an online fax service. The entry-level tier, at $9.99/300 pages/month, allows for many more pages than I presently need/use. Even at my current average report length, which is seven pages or so (including an appendix for scores), I could still send about 40 reports per month - far in excess of my current usage. For those with greater needs, additional tiers are available.

The Hello Fax service also provides you with a fax number so that you can receive faxes, as well. Not only does this save paper, but it is also a huge timesaver, since I don't have to manually feed in a paper report and fax it. Also, if your existing fax needs seem "free" because you don't get a monthly bill, then [reconsider][3] what your costs *actually* are. 

*Why*

It's not 1984.


[^2]: That you don't have to lease because it would otherwise cost $10 K. 

[^1]:	aka "The Cloud"

[^4]: As far as I can tell, this version is NOT worth the extra green, both figuratively and literally (Evernote products are all slathered in green).

[^5]: I use a Mac, but the mf4550 scanning drivers - and *only* the scanning drivers - are not compatible with Mac OS X. *Caveat Emptor*, ye would-be Canon buyers. Check OS compatibility before buying this or any other peripheral device. 

[^6]: For this, I use the oh-so-glorious service [HelloFax][2]
