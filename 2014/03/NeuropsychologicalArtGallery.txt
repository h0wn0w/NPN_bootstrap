Recently, we have started working on a few articles that will cover existing and emerging hardware and apps that can provide some degree of enhancement/rehabilitation to individuals with typical and atypical neurocognitive trajectories. In anticipation of these articles, it seemed like a good idea to provide a quick example of how a readily-available app can be used in everyday clinical practice. 

I frequently use an app called [Penultimate](https://itunes.apple.com/cz/app/penultimate/id354098826?mt=8) for both feedback psychoeducation. I like it for these and other purposes, and have received positive feedback from patients. Below are some examples, drawn (literally and figuratively) from clinical cases. [^1]
I'll stop here.
