## The Human Connectome Project ##


[The Human Connectome Project](http://humanconnectome.org) is a relatively new endeavor designed to map the brain's neural connections. The researchers clearly put in a good bit of effort [on one of their recent studies][1], and it's a good read. There have been [some](http://www.nih.gov/science/brain/) nice [advances](http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/biomedical/imaging/bigbrain-project-makes-terabyte-map-of-a-human-brain) over the past year or so. It will be exciting to watch these projects evolve along with our understanding of functional anatomy.
