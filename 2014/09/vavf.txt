Michael Sugarman, a doctoral student at Wayne State, sent us information about an article that he recently had published, along with co-author Bradley Axelrod, Ph.D., in *Applied Neuropsychology - Adult*. For this study, they investigated the performance validity characteristics of the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) and Category Fluency (Animals) in a sample drawn from an urban-based Veteran's Affairs hospital. In the end, they were able to define a logistic regression with some fairly decent discriminative power. Well done! 

If you want to read the full publication, you're in luck: Michael also sent a [link to the article][1] with 50 free downloads available. You know these will go quickly, so make your move and grab your copy now! 

Thanks again to Mike Sugarman and Dr. Axelrod for sending this along to us, so that we could get the word out to you.
