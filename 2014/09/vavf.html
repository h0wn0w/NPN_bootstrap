<p>Michael Sugarman, a doctoral student at Wayne State, sent us information about an article that he recently had published, along with co-author Bradley Axelrod, Ph.D., in <em>Applied Neuropsychology - Adult</em>. For this study, they investigated the performance validity characteristics of the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) and Category Fluency (Animals) in a sample drawn from an urban-based Veteran&#8217;s Affairs hospital. In the end, they were able to define a logistic regression with some fairly decent discriminative power. Well done! </p>

<p>If you want to read the full publication, you&#8217;re in luck: Michael also sent a <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/tKKBsZncDCbgc462IZRH/full#.VBbzxS6wI6I">link to the article</a> with 50 free downloads available. You know these will go quickly, so make your move and grab your copy now! </p>

<p>Thanks again to Mike Sugarman and Dr. Axelrod for sending this along to us, so that we could get the word out to you. </p>
