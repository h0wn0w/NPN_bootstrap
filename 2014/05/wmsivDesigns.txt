The Wechsler Memory Scales – IV (WMS-IV) replaced the much-maligned *Family Pictures* subtest with the questionable *Designs* subtest. You may have noticed that, occasionally, examinees will earn points for partially correct responses on *Designs*, leading to an artificially inflated Scaled Score. What kind of scores could be obtained, then, through chance alone?

Some of my colleagues from the University of Kansas – Wichita investigated that very idea, and their article was recently published in Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology. You owe it to yourself to give it a read if you use the WMS-IV. Read the abstract and/or download the full-text of *"Chance Performance and Floor Effects: Threats to the Validity of the Wechsler Memory Scale—Fourth Edition Designs Subtest"* [here].
