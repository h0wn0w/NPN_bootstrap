We have recently started working on a few articles that will cover existing and emerging hardware and apps that can provide some degree of enhancement/rehabilitation to individuals with typical and atypical neurocognitive trajectories. In anticipation of these articles, it seemed like a good idea to provide a quick example of how a readily-available app can be used in everyday clinical practice. 

I frequently use [Penultimate](https://itunes.apple.com/cz/app/penultimate/id354098826?mt=8) for both feedback psychoeducation. This application provides a blank slate that, in combination with a stylus [^1], affords free-form writing or drawing. Below are some examples, drawn (literally and figuratively) from clinical cases, [^2] of Penultimate in action.
