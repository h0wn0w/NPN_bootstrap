As of yesterday, *An Examination of the Frequency of Invalid Forgetting on the Test of Memory Malingering* was published as part of the online version of [The Clinical Neuropsychologist][3]. This article represents a *ton* of work by an excellent group of people that I had the pleasure of working with/learning from while on Fellowship at the University of Kansas School of Medicine - Wichita. It's actually an unofficial second of two articles, the [first][1] being published last year. 

Taylor & Francis, publishers of TCN, provided a link that allows for 50 free[^1] downloads of the article. Rather than give it to my 50 closest neuropsychology friends, it seemed that making the link available here was more in line with the Neuropsych Now goal of providing (ostensibly) clinically valuable resources for little or no money. 

Again, there are only 50 copies to be (legitimately) had for free, so if you're interested, [download the article now][2].

One more thing: are you interested in sharing *your* article with a wider audience? [Let us know](mailto:admin@neuropsychnow.com) and we'll post it on Neuropsych Now![^2]
