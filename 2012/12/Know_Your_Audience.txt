Report writing is a skill set that evolves over the course of a career. Among the many challenges of writing a sound report is tailoring it for the intended recipient. Of course, the patient is not always the only person you're writing the report for. Indeed, while the patient may often be the person who ultimately often benefits from it, rarely are our reports written in a language that they would understand. Occasionally, the patient will never get the report at all, such as in an Independent Medical Exam. Some possible recipients of your report include: 

1. The patient
2. Primary care physician
3. Psychiatrist
4. Attorney
5. Judge
6. Government agency
7. School administration and/or teachers

Clearly, a wide array of individuals might be reading and interpret your report. Each of them will look at it in a different way; therefore, we should write the report in a way that is most meaningful to the party *most directly connected with the patient*. If writing a report for a forensic evaluation requested by an attorney, you are answering one or more very specific questions and are not offering recommendations for treatment. A psychiatrist is likely most interested in the patient's final diagnoses, as this will affect their treatment decisions, and so forth. Understanding at the outset that there is no one correct format for report writing will eventually enhance your skill.
