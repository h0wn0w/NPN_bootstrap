Hopefully, you've read through [Data Backups, Part I](Link) and are now sufficiently fearful of losing all the ones and zeros stored on your office machine(s). Now it's time to get into the mechanics of a backup system. Though there are many ways by which one can backup a computer and/or files, there are some universally agreed-upon tenets. The first of which is *back up your data!* Another is *backup your data...twice.* Without further delay, here is what you need and what you need to do.

## Local Backups

Local backups refer to those that are "in house," and are more or less attached to your computer. There are two main kinds of local backup strategies: system/file backups and cloned backups. 

1. **System and/or File-Level Backups**

	* This type backs up only the changes of certain files and directories that occurred since the last backup (referred to as an *incremental backup*). These files and directories are determined by you, the end-user.
	* For this type of backup, you may be able to get away with one of the smaller media types (LINK TO PREVIOUS ARTICLE), particularly if you're only backing up a few files here and there. 

		* Pros
			* Backups are small and fast 
			* Easy to run on a preset schedule (e.g., once per hour)
			* In the event of damaged files, crashes, etc., only changes since the last backup are lost
		* Cons
			* Not bootable (see next section)
			* Incomplete solution

2. **Cloned Backups**

	* **Cloned backups** are complete, bootable copies of your computer's main Hard Disk Drive (HDD). In the event of catastrophic failure, this strategy will allow you to get back up and running with the least amount of headache and heartache. 
	* For this type, you will need a full-fledged HDD, preferably one *at least* twice the size of your computer's internal HDD. So, if your computer has a 500 GigaByte (500 GB) HDD, you would want a 1 TeraByte (1 TB) backup HDD. This allows you to make ongoing backups without running out of hard drive space too quickly. 

		* Pros
			* An utterly complete copy of the computer 
			* Bootable - any other computer running the same operating system as your computer can be booted from this disk[^1]
			* You can resume business as usual almost immediately
		* Cons
			* Backups take longer, since the entire system must be scanned for changes first
			* Time between backups is usually longer (e.g., once per day)

	* The ways that a clone can be used to save your bacon are:

		1. Attach the cloned drive to another computer running the same operating system (OS) and boot from it[^1] 
		2. Physically swap the failed HDD with the cloned HDD
		3. Restore the failed computer by cloning the backup to your computer's internal HDD 

Here are some good instructions for cloning [Windows](http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/663-backup-complete-computer-create-image-backup.html) and [Mac OS X](http://macs.about.com/od/applications/tp/usingosxdiskutility.htm). For a more versatile Mac cloning solution, both [Super Duper!](http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/) and [Carbon Copy Cloner](www.bombich.com) are excellent choices, but cost about $30 and $40, respectively.[^2] At the end of the day, whatever system you choose, it really *must* be automated. At the risk of stating the obvious, an automated system is essential to every true backup system because it relieves you of having to remember to perform a backup. This is important, because *you will forget to do this or you will allow it to slip from any routine you've established.* Both Mac and Windows operating systems ship with automated backup programs. So, you have no excuse. Just do it. Set it up. As soon as you've finished reading this post, of course, because there is more yet to learn. 

## Online Backup Services

One of the keys to bulletproofing a backup strategy is redundancy, meaning that you have more than one backup of whatever it is you consider necessary and/or important. Online backups are a great way to diversify and create redundancy in a backup strategy. The diversification aspect stems from the nature of these types of backups: they're not physically in your posession. This means that Acts of God and Nature on your real estate (e.g., house/office burned down, flooded, etc.) might destroy your local backups, but you'll still have a redundant, online backup to restore from. 

There are several of these, including but not limited to:

* [Mozy](http://mozy.com/)
* [Crash Plan](http://b5.crashplan.com/consumer/download.html)
* [Backblaze](http://www.backblaze.com/)

As with everything else, you'll want to look around and see what fits best. 

## Synchronization Services

Finally, you might also want to consider a synchronization service. Synchronization is not backup, per se, but it does afford some additional level of protection. Most often these services are used to keep select folders and files on two or more devices in sync. This is accomplished by an application or process that, once launched, runs silently in the background. Those same folders and files can also be accessed via the Internet, so you can pull directly from the company's site if need be. 

Examples of some more synchronization services include: 

* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com)
* [Spider Oak](https://spideroak.com)
* [Box](https://www.box.com/)

Three aspects of the Spider Oak service are very much germane to the interests of Neuropsychologists[^3]. The first is they are the service that fully encrypts your data before it's transferred to their servers. The second is that they have a "zero-knowledge" policy and approach to data handling. In short, their customer service won't be of any help if you lose your password, since no one has the means to access it. Finally, their methods of data transfer and storage are HIPAA-compliant. There's more to this policy, so be sure to check out their [FAQ page](https://spideroak.com/faq/category/privacy__passwords/) for more information. 

## Wrapping Up

For further reading, [here is a fantastic post](http://www.43folders.com/2010/03/15/yes-another-backup-lecture) written by Merlin Mann, who is quite well known in certain circles for his perspectives on the [Getting Things Done](http://www.davidco.com/about-gtd) system. If you don't feel like reading it, here's his all-important summary on backups: 

* If it's not automated, it's not a real backup.
* If it's not redundant, it's not a real backup.
* If it's not regularly rotated off-site, it's not a real backup.
