The The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) guidelines established the [Privacy Rule](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/srsummary.html), which grated federal protection to protected health information (PHI). HIPAA is something that all practitioners should know and understand. All students since the late nineties should have received at least *some* instruction regarding HIPAA as part of their graduate education. The transmission and storage of Electronic Medical Records (EMR), however, is one of those things that probably falls into the category of "*things they didn't teach you in graduate school*." This specific topic is addressed in [*The Nationwide Privacy and Security Framework for Electronic Exchange of Individually Identifiable Health Information*](http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt?open=512&objID=1173&parentname=CommunityPage&parentid=3&mode=2&in_hi_userid=10741&cached=true) portion of HIPAA. Relatively simplified fact sheets can be found [here](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/special/healthit/index.html) To state things conservatively, the health care world is moving towards a full EMR system. More accurately, major health care organizations are already there. In 2003, [The Kaiser Permanante Healthcare System](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/html/kaiser/index.shtml) was one of the first in the nation to introduce a way for patients to access and manage many aspects of their healthcare, beyond just their records. Their [EMR system](http://thrive.kaiserpermanente.org/healthy-innovations) affords scheduling appointments and more (the web site is functional and *extremely* well-designed, too). The point is not about keeping up with trends or living up to aspirational guidelines, though. The take home message is knowledge and compliance with these standards, and there's good reason for it. 

The following caveat was issued in the APA's most recent issuance of record keeping guidelines (APA, 2007):[^1]  
>"Appropriate security procedures protect against the loss of or unauthorized access to the record, which could have serious consequences for both the client and psychologist. Access to the records is limited in order to safeguard against physical and electronic breaches of the confidentiality of the information. Advances in technology, especially in electronic record keeping, may create new challenges for psychologists in their efforts to maintain the security of their records (see Guideline 9)."

New challenges, indeed. Since the beginning of 2011 through the writing of this post in mid-December 2012, nearly 8.2 medical records have been compromised in some way. Among the many threats to Protected Health Informatio (PHI) are malicious hackers, physician loss, and unintended disclosure; there are other sources. If these numbers seem absurd, please conduct your own query at the [Privacy Rights Clearinghouse](https://www.privacyrights.org/). After a report gets generated, scroll down. It's a very, very long page. Each event in which records were compromised is logged, with a description of exactly what was compromised and how it happened. So, what measures can practitioners use to help safeguard data? 

<!-- The most reliable storage and transmission systems are imminently prone to failure in the hands of non-savvy or uninformed individuals. In light of this quandary/conundrum, additional measures must also be technically easy to implement,  -->

### Do:

* Encrypt HDD or User folder using programs like [True Crypt] or [File Vault] (for Mac OS X)
* Use WPA2/PSK-secured network at your office AND home 
* Use [SFTP](https://duckduckgo.com/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol)

### Don't

* Use Google Docs or SkyDrive or equivalent service for storing your patients' PHI. This is just asking for trouble.
* Create passwords using English-language words. These are easily cracked with a [Dictionary Attack]
* Use FTP (use SFTP instead - see above)

#### Passwords

* Your computer should be password protected. Several applications are available to help you both create and manage strong passwords. Here are a few of them to help get you started:
	* [Symantec Password Generator](http://www.pctools.com/guides/password/)
	* [1Password (for Windows and Mac desktops, as well as Android and iOS)](https://agilebits.com/onepassword)
	* [KeePass](http://keepass.info/)
* Use strong passwords
* Use DIFFERENT passwords for EVERY account you have. No, this is not as easy as what you're used to. Yes, you will thank yourself for putting in the extra work now

A lot has been covered in this post. In part two, the main points of the HIPAA guidelines will be covered. Most importantly, How can you get your practice up to HIPAA compliance standards?
