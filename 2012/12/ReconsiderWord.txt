Ask yourself a few quick questions: 

* How often do you really need a full-featured word processor? 
* How often would a "simple" text editor get the job done? 
* What is a word processor, and how is it different from a text editor?

That last question is one that most people (a) have never thought to ask, and (b) probably can't effectively answer. The short answer is that a word processor is for typsetting/formatting text, and a text editor is for writing/authoring text. Now ask yourself another question: when writing reports, are you formatting or writing? Correct - you're writing. Of course, you can author text in either of those two applications, right? So, at the end of the day, what's the difference between them? Isn't *Word* way better than a relatively featureless text editor? Let's examine that last question. 

Let's start answering that question by looking at not your desktop computer, but your mobile device(s). You all but certainly have a touchscreen phone that affords you computing power that none of us dreamed possible just a few years ago. If you own a tablet, it's probably an iPad.[^1] Thus, you at least have the *ability* to access and work on files in "the cloud," which can increase your efficiency.[^2] The problem is, if you're writing all of your reports with Microsoft *Word*, your options are limited. Like, number-of-movie-theaters-in-Greenland limited. If you really want to get serious work done on the road, a text editor is the only way to go. In fact, if you want to get serious work done on your desktop computer, the same holds true. 

If you want to edit *Word* (.doc or .docx files) on your iPad or iPhone, [here are your choices](http://www.macworld.com/article/1151397/word_ipad.html). If you work with plain text files (.txt), [iOS text editors](http://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors/) you have far more choices. If you don't have time to go through those two links, here's a summary: there are 78 text editors for iOS devices as compared to eight that will handle *Word* files. Of those eight, only one is free. The benefits of using plain text files for report writing extend beyond the mobile realm, though: plain text files will open on any computer and/or operating system that has ever been made. The same cannot be said about *Word* files. So, if you're looking for a *truly* portable way to write your reports, there is no better choice than plain text. Of course, you'll want your reports to have a professional fit and finish, and that is when a word processor should come into the workflow. When you're done with writing the report, simply cut and paste the text into *Word* and format as necessary. 

<!-- Many, if not most, offices, practices, and individuals still use Microsoft Word. It seems like this venerable application has been around forever - a stalwart - and *will* be around forever. Think back and try to remember another word processor called [*Word Perfect*](http://www.corel.com/corel/product/index.jsp?pid=prod4720105&cid=catalog20038&segid=6400043). If you're able to remember this program, then you may also remember it was the *Word* of its day. It seemed that we'd be authoring articles, reports, etc., with the *.wp* extension forever. That was until Microsoft Word became the *defacto* king of word processors in the late 1990's and early 2000's, riding along with the rest of Microsoft to the top of the computing world. *Word* was embraced as the Next Great Thing.  -->
