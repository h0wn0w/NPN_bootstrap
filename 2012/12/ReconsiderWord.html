<p>Ask yourself a few quick questions: </p>

<ul>
<li>How often do you really need a full-featured word processor?</li>
<li>How often would a &#8220;simple&#8221; text editor get the job done?</li>
<li>What is a word processor, and how is it different from a text editor?</li>
</ul>

<p>That last question is one that most people (a) have never thought to ask, and (b) probably can&#8217;t effectively answer. The short answer is that a word processor is for typsetting/formatting text, and a text editor is for writing/authoring text. Now ask yourself another question: when writing reports, are you formatting or writing? Correct - you&#8217;re writing. Of course, you can author text in either of those two applications, right? So, at the end of the day, what&#8217;s the difference between them? Isn&#8217;t <em>Word</em> way better than a relatively featureless text editor? Let&#8217;s examine that last question. </p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start answering that question by looking at not your desktop computer, but your mobile device(s). You all but certainly have a touchscreen phone that affords you computing power that none of us dreamed possible just a few years ago. If you own a tablet, it&#8217;s probably an iPad.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> Thus, you at least have the <em>ability</em> to access and work on files in &#8220;the cloud,&#8221; which can increase your efficiency.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> The problem is, if you&#8217;re writing all of your reports with Microsoft <em>Word</em>, your options are limited. Like, number-of-movie-theaters-in-Greenland limited. If you really want to get serious work done on the road, a text editor is the only way to go. In fact, if you want to get serious work done on your desktop computer, the same holds true. </p>

<p>If you want to edit <em>Word</em> (.doc or .docx files) on your iPad or iPhone, <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1151397/word_ipad.html">here are your choices</a>. If you work with plain text files (.txt), <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors/">iOS text editors</a> you have far more choices. If you don&#8217;t have time to go through those two links, here&#8217;s a summary: there are 78 text editors for iOS devices as compared to eight that will handle <em>Word</em> files. Of those eight, only one is free. The benefits of using plain text files for report writing extend beyond the mobile realm, though: plain text files will open on any computer and/or operating system that has ever been made. The same cannot be said about <em>Word</em> files. So, if you&#8217;re looking for a <em>truly</em> portable way to write your reports, there is no better choice than plain text. Of course, you&#8217;ll want your reports to have a professional fit and finish, and that is when a word processor should come into the workflow. When you&#8217;re done with writing the report, simply cut and paste the text into <em>Word</em> and format as necessary. </p>

<!-- Many, if not most, offices, practices, and individuals still use Microsoft Word. It seems like this venerable application has been around forever - a stalwart - and *will* be around forever. Think back and try to remember another word processor called [*Word Perfect*](http://www.corel.com/corel/product/index.jsp?pid=prod4720105&cid=catalog20038&segid=6400043). If you're able to remember this program, then you may also remember it was the *Word* of its day. It seemed that we'd be authoring articles, reports, etc., with the *.wp* extension forever. That was until Microsoft Word became the *defacto* king of word processors in the late 1990's and early 2000's, riding along with the rest of Microsoft to the top of the computing world. *Word* was embraced as the Next Great Thing.  -->
