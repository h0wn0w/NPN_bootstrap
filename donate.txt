Thank you for considering a donation to Neuropsych Now. Our work here is done as a means to help enhance the field of neuropsychology, and we hope that it continues to grow over time. If you like what you see, and/or have found any of our content and resources to be valuable, please let us know by donating $0.09, or "Nine for Neuropsych Now." That's nine pennies - something that we could've afforded even as *grad students*! 

Small donations will help to ensure the future of this site. We presently pay for these costs ourselves, and will continue to do so as long as there is a demand.  

100% of any funds donated will be directly contributed to our operating costs:  

1. Site hosting bandwidth at [NearlyFreeSpeech.Net](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/) - this is where the Neuropsych Now Web site is hosted.
2. [Amazon web services](http://aws.amazon.com/) bandwidth - we use Amazon web services as our Content Distribution Network (or CDN) to efficiently serve up media of all types (e.g., images, video).
