        <h3>Help Keep The Lights On</h3>
    	<p>Thank you for considering a donation to Neuropsych Now. This site is a means to help enhance the practice of neuropsychology, and we hope that it continues to grow over time. If you like what you see, and/or have found value in any of our content and resources, please let us know by making a micro-donation of 9 cents to Neuropsych Now. That&#8217;s just 9 pennies, but that amount keeps us running for a day (on average). These small donations will help to ensure the future of this site.</p>

        <p>We presently pay for all costs ourselves, and will continue to do so as long as there is a demand. Please know that 100% of each donation is used to offset our operating costs, which are: </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Site hosting bandwidth and email at <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/" target="_blank">NearlyFreeSpeech.Net</a> - this is where the Neuropsych Now Web site is hosted. </li>
            <li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank"@>Amazon web services</a> bandwidth - we use Amazon web services as our Content Distribution Network (or CDN) to efficiently serve up media of all types (e.g., images, video).</li>
        </ol>

        <p>We sincerely thank everyone for their ongoing support of Neuropsych Now!</p>
