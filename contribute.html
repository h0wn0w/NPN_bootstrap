        <h3>Help Keep The Write On</h3>
        <p>Neuropsych Now is all about delivering high-quality, easily accessible content to neuropsychology students and clinicians. If you've visited a couple of our pages, then you probably have a sense of what we're talking about. </p>

        <p>We work hard to deliver as much original content as possible, but we&#8217;re also counting on input from other neuropsychology clinicians and students. Contributions are, we believe, the key to growing into a resource unlike anything ever seen in the field of neuropsychology. So, we&#8217;re accepting submissions for any information that you think others would benefit from (such as a link or original content). </p>

        <p>If you're interested in contributing an article, please first read our <a href="terms.html">Terms & Conditions page</a>. If you are comfortable with our terms and have something you'd like to submit, then please send us an <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#x61;&#x64;&#109;&#x69;&#110;&#64;&#x6e;&#x65;&#117;&#114;&#111;&#112;&#x73;&#121;&#99;&#x68;&#x6e;&#x6f;&#119;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#101;&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;</a> with your content included/attached. </p>

        <p>While we want people to get involved with Neuropsych Now, please understand that we can't/won't publish or link everything that comes our way. There are many different reasons for this, which are outlined on the <a href="terms.html">Terms & Conditions page</a>.</p>

        <h3>Help Keep The Lights On</h3>
    	<p>Neuropsych Now is a means to help enhance the practice of neuropsychology, and we hope that it continues to grow over time. If you like what you see, and/or have found value in any of our content and resources, please let us know by making a micro-donation of 9 cents to Neuropsych Now. That&#8217;s just 9 pennies, but that amount keeps us running for a day (on average). These small donations will help to ensure the future of this site.</p>

        <p>We presently pay for all costs ourselves, and will continue to do so as long as there is a demand. Please know that 100% of each donation is used to offset our operating costs, which are: </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Site hosting bandwidth and email at <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/" target="_blank">NearlyFreeSpeech.Net</a> - this is where the Neuropsych Now Web site is hosted. </li>
            <li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank"@>Amazon web services</a> bandwidth - we use Amazon web services as our Content Distribution Network (or CDN) to efficiently serve up media of all types (e.g., images, video).</li>
        </ol>

        <p>We sincerely thank everyone for their ongoing support of Neuropsych Now!</p>
